**Four projects got rugged through their shared anti-rug mechanism.**  
  

[Team Finance](https://twitter.com/TeamFinance_), the self-proclaimed “_Industry Leader In Project Security & Automation_”, lost [$15.8M](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1585587858978623491?s=20&t=JIa5322R7nAnqNfbcBT_ag) of funds that it was supposed to be safeguarding.

  

Of the four pools drained, [FEG](https://twitter.com/FEGtoken), [Caw](https://twitter.com/CommunityCaw), and [Kondux](https://twitter.com/Kondux_KNDX) were the worst hit. [Tsuka](https://twitter.com/Dejitaru_Tsuka/) was also affected, but experienced less price impact due to a secondary [liquidity pool on Uniswap v3.](https://twitter.com/Dejitaru_Tsuka/status/1585578999484399618)

The project’s website claims to protect over $2.5B of assets, but considering the low liquidity of their selection of shitcoins, we can consider this claim to be optimistic at best.  
  
**#46 on the [leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/).**

The [announcement](https://twitter.com/TeamFinance_/status/1585562380591063043) of the hack explained that the exploit targeted “_the audited v2 to v3 migration function._”

  

The vulnerability was contained in one of the [Liquidity Locks](https://docs.team.finance/token-locks/liquidity-locks)’ “bulletproof smart contracts” which allowed projects to migrate locked LP positions from Uni v2 to Uni v3.

  

According to Peckshield’s [analysis](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1585587858978623491):

  

>The protocol has a flawed migrate() that is exploited to transfer real UniswapV2 liquidity to an attacker-controlled new V3 pair with skewed price, resulting in huge leftover as the refund for profit. Also, the authorized sender check is bypassed by locking any tokens.

**The breakdown of the loss to each project’s Uniswap v2 pool is as follows:**

  

$11.5M CAW

  

$1.7M TSUKA

  

$0.7M KNDX

  

$1.9M FEG

The vulnerable migrate() function was included in Zokyo Security’s [audit](https://github.com/trustswap/audits/blob/main/TrustSwap%20(token%20lock)%20audit%20report.pdf) of Team Finance contracts from August this year.

**“DAO tooling” was amongst the most popular buzzwords throughout the last cycle.**

For small, anon teams working on innovative protocols, it may be tempting to outsource trust to a third party. But given the array of shitcoins “secured” by Team Finance, the vaults seem more likely to be a way for projects to appear trustworthy by proxy.

**Now that it’s clear that trust has been lost.**

_Will this protocol take one for the team and reimburse the victims, or is it every man for himself?_

**There’s no $ in Team.**
