_Some get 15 minutes of fame, some stay too long...._

  

**In the attention-hungry world of crypto, every viral moment seems to spawn a token.**

  

Enter Hailey Welch, the "Hawk Tuah girl," whose [$HAWK token](https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr) soared to a dizzying $490 million market cap before [plummeting 91% in just three hours](https://blocknews.com/memecoin-launch-ends-in-controversy-as-hawk-tuah-loses-91-in-hours/).

  

While Welch tweeted assurances about "no team selling," on-chain data painted a different picture – one where [96% of tokens](https://x.com/AlexMasonCrypto/status/1864702755719303206) nestled comfortably in just ten connected wallets before launch.

  

A single sniper wallet walked away with $1.3 million in profit while retail investors watched their investments evaporate.

  
**In an era where celebrity-backed tokens have become a speed run to disaster, $HAWK may have just set a new record.**
  
_As investors cry foul and [law firms circle](https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1864708561030217746) overhead, some are already muttering "[talk Tuah lawyer](https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1864724761730802042)" – perhaps there's such a thing as too much attention after all?_

**"Not a cash grab," [insisted Haliey Welch](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/12/04/hawk-tuah-girl-haliey-welch-launches-crypto-memecoin-solana/) before she launched her [$HAWK](https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr) meme coin on Solana.**  
  
The project, [backed by Web3 launchpad overHere](https://decrypt.co/293609/web3-launchpad-platform-overhere-launches-hawk-haliey-welchs-official-hawk-tuah-memecoin) and promoted as a bridge between mainstream and crypto audiences, would prove to be anything but stable.  
  
Three hours later, $430 million in market cap had vanished into thin air.

  

"Hawk is live!!!" [she tweeted](https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864434514610782583), dropping the [contract address](https://solscan.io/token/HAWKThXRcNL9ZGZKqgUXLm4W8tnRZ7U6MVdEepSutj34) that would lead thousands to slaughter.  
  
_What unfolded next would make even seasoned crypto veterans wince. HAWK surged 900% as its market cap rocketed to $490 million._  
  
**Then gravity kicked in.**

  

The [token hemorrhaged 91% of its value](https://blocknews.com/memecoin-launch-ends-in-controversy-as-hawk-tuah-loses-91-in-hours/), falling to a mere $41.7 million market cap within a few hours.

  

The team's solution to prevent sniping? High initial fees on Meteora's protocol.

  

_Spoiler alert: it didn't work._

  

**One particularly sharp-eyed predator didn't just snipe - they carpet-bombed the launch.**

  

Seconds after deployment, a single wallet snatched 17.5% of the supply, [dropping 4,195 WSOL](https://solscan.io/tx/3YgV7UitWdBz2vuCDDJnHR8DjdEBL7kzPxRWsqLXZ1kgLj6YbTJr9Hwn5NXv2qGW9h3pGhHV7m8Fjwze2zuwZSDn) ($965.4k) like it was pocket change.

  

Ninety minutes later, they'd flipped roughly [177.8 million HAWK tokens](https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr?maker=HiiqhjDF8hgeBbnbZNdkyjx6Wvy2oefvh85GokojbRnN) for a cool $1.3 million profit.

  

Meanwhile, on the other side of the food chain, retail investors got plucked.

  

_One [unfortunate soul](https://x.com/_PPMan_/status/1864452135007539509) allegedly swapped $1.4 million of MOODENG into HAWK, only to watch their investment evaporate faster than promises in a bull market._

  

**As if the launch drama wasn't enough, [enter Coffeezilla](https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1864540809921429946) - one of crypto's favorite detectives - who [crashed Hawk Tuah’s Spaces](https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1864585278469390809) livestream to press for answers about the millions allegedly scammed.**  
  
The sudden appearance of crypto's most notorious scam investigator turned the already chaotic launch into a full-blown spectacle, but that did not last, as [he was muted](https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1864547262392569968).  
  
Was it something he said?

  

The Spaces continued, but the damage was done.

  

_Coffeezilla had stoked a fire that couldn't be extinguished._
  

**And when the discussion turned to those suspicious fees and token distribution, Welch delivered perhaps one of the most Hawkward exit in crypto history - [announcing she was "going to bed" mid-Spaces discussion](https://x.com/TheMisterFrog/status/1864556778911887635).**
  

Nothing says legitimate project quite like ducking hard questions with a virtual Irish goodbye.

  

The whole episode left investors wondering: if there's nothing to hide, why rush to hibernate?

  

Though perhaps after watching millions evaporate in hours, sleep felt like the best defense against an increasingly angry mob of investors demanding answers about their vanishing funds.

  

But when millions vanish in hours, can any explanation really put out the fires of fury?

  

**The spin doctors arrived right on schedule...**

  

_"There has been a wild amount of fud circulating, let us explain," began [overHere's desperate narrative control](https://x.com/overHere_gg/status/1864503127019540912)._

  
Their defense of the suspicious Bubblemaps data showing 96% token concentration?  
  
Everything was "according to tokenomics."

  

The team claimed the clustered wallets simply reflected their [published distribution](https://x.com/ZeusLFG/status/1864448873881592212?t=xE9tfOWz0wCGI8CdgaZCng&s=19): 21% community fund, 20% for Haliey's fans, 30% reserve, 17% strategic allocation, 10% for Haliey (locked), and a mere 2% for public allocation.

  

"Haliey's Team has sold absolutely no tokens whatsoever," they insisted, explaining that her allocation was locked for a year with a three-year vesting schedule.  
  
**A noble gesture, perhaps - if only the other 90% of tokens weren't free to roam.**

  

_When a token dumps 91% in three hours, [do the market mechanics care](https://x.com/ZeusLFG/status/1864448873881592212?t=xE9tfOWz0wCGI8CdgaZCng&s=19) about your lock period?_

  

### Birds of a Feather  
  

_But this bird didn't fly solo. The launch didn't happen in a vacuum._

  

**A month before, Welch had posted a [curious warning](https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1854226723501383698): "Not my token, plz don't get scammed," directing inquiries about meme coins to [Doc Hollywood](https://x.com/DocHollywoodArt) and [SolanaSweeper](https://x.com/SweeperSolana).**

  

Turns out she was half right - it was her token, but the scamming part aged like fine wine.  
  
During [Coffeezilla's video dissection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUHq8AWR1Rg) of the carnage, [her lawyer let slip](https://x.com/franklinisbored/status/1864824231394943040) the real compensation - $125,000 upfront plus 50% of net proceeds from her token allocation.

  

As the token continued its descent, law firms began circling like vultures after a desert storm.

  

[Burwick Law took to X](https://x.com/BurwickLaw/status/1864467285072597184), inviting anyone who lost money on $HAWK to "learn about their legal rights."

  

_Some users [claimed to have already filed SEC complaints](https://x.com/NFTherder/status/1864480669440614876) - perhaps they'll hear back right after SafeMoon investors get their refunds._

  

**The real verdict may come not from regulators or lawyers, but from the market itself.**  
  
While fingers pointed at Welch's team, blockchain data reveals a different culprit - part of the 17% [Strategic Allocation went to 285 investors](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1864707143825227981) from the HAWKXJ address, fully unlocked at launch.

  

These early birds didn't waste time, promptly dumping on newcomers.

  

**When early investors feast on latecomers, who's really to blame - the face on the token or the invisible hands that dump it?**

  

At least one crafty sniper’s wallet walked away with $1.3 million in profit, countless others were left holding bags lighter than their initial expectations.

  

At least someone was paying attention to the red flags while others were busy refreshing their Twitter feeds for the next viral moment.

  

**In crypto's attention economy, maybe the real alpha is knowing when to look away.**
  
_In the attention economy, is infamy just as valuable as fame?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)






_In crypto's endless pursuit of the next moonshot, even fifteen minutes of fame can feel like an eternity._

  

**While Haliey Welch rode the wave from meme to meme coin, many investors learned an expensive lesson about the true cost of viral fame.**

  

The 'How Not to Get Rekt' playbook should be required reading for every crypto degen by now - Chapter One: Celebrity tokens are hazardous to your wallet's health.

  

Yet here we are again, watching retail investors chase celebrity tokens like moths to an increasingly expensive flame.

  

_As P.T. Barnum allegedly quipped, "There's a sucker born every minute and two to take him" - though in crypto's attention economy, those odds feel conservative._

  

The intersection of clout and crypto desperately needs a new breed of gatekeeper - one that can bridge the gap between viral moments and viable tokens, before more reputations get rekt and wallets get rugged.

  

**Perhaps the real rug pull isn't the friends we made along the way, but the belief that this time would somehow be different.**

  

_As law firms circle and regulators sharpen their talons, how many more fans need to get plucked before we admit that sometimes fifteen minutes of fame is fourteen minutes too long?_
