_In the high-stakes game of crypto exchanges, Indodax just crapped out._

  

**Over $25 million vanished faster than you can say rupiah in the latest episode of "Centralized Exchange Calamities: Southeast Asian Edition."**

  

On September 10th, Indodax, Indonesia's largest crypto exchange, learned a costly lesson in the dangers of wallet management and the persistence of sophisticated hacking groups.

  

As alerts of the exploit spread, observers watched in fascination as the hackers performed their dark magic, siphoning funds across multiple chains with the finesse of a digital David Copperfield.

  

**In the world of centralized exchanges, "not your keys, not your crypto" isn't just a catchy slogan, it's a warning that keeps ringing true.**

  

_In the wake of this Indonesian crypto tsunami, will Indodax's reputation be as leaky as its security protocols?_

**The first signs of trouble came when [Cyvers raised the alarm](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1833629057256239175) on Twitter: "Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving your wallets on different networks."**  
  

It didn't take long for the blockchain sleuths to mobilize.

  

_Within hours, a [clearer picture emerged](https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1833750952832368885) of the devastation:_

  

6.14M USDT

1,047 ETH ($2.48M)

25 BTC ($1.41M)

2.2M MATIC ($849K)

1.4M ARB ($749.6K)

2M ENA ($465K)

...and the list goes on totaling roughly $25.22 million.

  
As the crypto sleuths pieced together the digital breadcrumbs, a familiar pattern began to emerge.

  

**Yosi Hammer, Head of AI at Cyvers, provided some intriguing insights:**

  

_"While it is premature to confirm the involvement of any specific group, the attack's speed and complexity, the pattern and the characteristics of the attack highly resembles those of North Korea's Lazarus Group."_  
  
Hammer, however, emphasized that it’s too early to confirm the attackers’ identity.

  

[SlowMist's analysis](https://x.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1833757841880158673) ruled out a simple hot wallet compromise, suggesting a more insidious breach of the withdrawal system itself.

  

_In a move that would make Ocean's Eleven blush, the hackers managed to initiate withdrawals that looked legitimate, complete with change addresses depositing back into Indodax._

  

**Compromised Indodax hot wallets:**

  

**Eth/Polygon:** [0x3C02290922a3618A4646E3BbCa65853eA45FE7C6  ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3c02290922a3618a4646e3bbca65853ea45fe7c6)

**BTC:**  [1JUToCyRL5UwgeucjnFAagKs4v1YqhjT1d  ](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1JUToCyRL5UwgeucjnFAagKs4v1YqhjT1d)

As onlookers held their collective breath, Indodax finally broke their silence, announcing a "complete maintenance" to ensure system integrity.

  

In a move that surely instilled confidence, [Indodax co-founder William Sutanto assured users](https://x.com/WilliamSutant0/status/1833765539375874282) that their funds were "100% safe both in crypto and rupiah."

  

Because nothing says "everything's fine" like completely shutting down your platform.

  

_The hackers, meanwhile, weren't content with their initial haul._  
  
**Like kids in a crypto candy store, they proceeded to swap their ill-gotten gain and moved their stolen loot here:**

_In this game of cat and mouse, it seems the attackers have once again proven they're the Garfield of the crypto world- fat, sassy, and always getting the lasagna._

  

**With [Cyvers reporting over 150 transactions](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1833635448834466252) in this digital heist, untangling this crypto yarn promises to be more complex than decoding a teenager's TikTok feed.**  
  

One thing's for sure: when the post-mortem drops, it'll be a page-turner that'd make even the most hardened crypto-detective's head spin.

  

Grab your popcorn, folks, this blockchain whodunit is far from over.

  
The stolen stash was a relatively small amount as the exchange’s wallets continue to hold over $400 million worth of various tokens, as [Arkham data shows](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/indodax).  
  
**[Back in June 2023](https://id.beincrypto.com/cyvers-deteksi-rp280-miliar-transaksi-mencurigakan-di-indodax-kena-hack/), Indonesian cops nabbed a duo of digital doppelgangers who were masquerading as Indodax on social media.**  
  
These crafty con artists were peddling fool's gold to unsuspecting marks, managing to pilfer a cool 625 million Indonesian Rupiah (about $40,500) before the law caught up with them.  
  

**Indodax's misfortune serves as a stark reminder that in the wild east of crypto exchanges, even the biggest fish can get caught in a net.**  
  
_When exchanges are playing whack-a-mole with threats ranging from two-bit hustlers to sophisticated hackers wielding nation-state level techniques, is "not your keys, not your crypto" less of a mantra and more of a survival guide?_

_It's a tale as old as Bitcoin, in the rush to provide liquidity, security sometimes takes a back seat._

  

**As the crypto space continues to grapple with the reality of highly sophisticated hacking groups, it's clear that even more rigorous security measures are needed.**

  

But in a world where exchanges are locked in an arms race with some of the most skilled hackers on the planet, can we really expect them to keep up?

  

Is it too much to ask exchanges that hold millions in user funds to better secure their hot wallets, implement stricter withdrawal controls, and maybe hire a security guard named Brutus?

  

In this case, it appears so.

  

**For now, Indodax joins the ever-growing list of exchanges that have fallen victim to high-profile digital heists.**

  

_As hackers continue to target crypto exchanges with increasing sophistication, one has to wonder: Is your favorite exchange next on their hit list or have they already paid their "security debt"?_
