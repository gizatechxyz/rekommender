_Nine fingers._

  

**That's all Ledger's co-founder had left after one of crypto's wildest events.**

  

It is a story that reads like a Hollywood script.  
  
A tech founder who built his fortune securing other people's wealth becomes the target.

  

**Professional kidnappers. A severed finger. A $10 million ransom. An elite police unit racing against time.**

  

But this isn't another thriller streaming on Netflix. This [happened January 21st](https://x.com/0xLouisT/status/1882711063306666287) in Vierzon, France.

  

[David Balland](https://x.com/Morveus), [Ledger](https://x.com/Ledger) co-founder (who has since left the company), was about to learn the true cost of success in crypto's darkest chapter.

  

No hardware wallet could protect him now. No multisig setup could stop what came next.

  

**In crypto's latest horror show, the real nightmare isn't the story – it's that it actually happened.**

  

_Have we traded bank robbers for something far more ruthless in our endless chase for financial freedom?_

**Welcome to 2025's first brutal reminder that not all exploits need code or access to private keys.**

  

In our "[Digital Danger](https://rekt.news/digital-danger/)" investigation, we documented crypto's [growing body count](https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks?tab=readme-ov-file).

  

From Costa Rica's beaches to Ukraine's forests, each story wrote itself in blood.

  

Now, a Ledger co-founder's mutilated hand writes one of crypto's darkest chapters yet.

  

This isn't about code anymore. This isn't about exploits or audits. This is about survival.

  

_The scene was set in Vierzon, France._

  
**The cast and crew were ready for their mark.**  
  

Ten assailants. Two targets.

  

The script was ready - but this script had a message written in blood.

  

The crew of assailants had done their research.

  

In a bull market, who better to target than someone who'd built an empire keeping crypto safe?

  

_[WhatsApp accounts traced to Southeast Asia](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_) masked their moves while Balland and his wife were already separated – a forced hard fork of flesh and blood._

  

**The price? One hundred Bitcoin. Ten million dollars. Two lives hanging in the balance.**

  

But these weren't your average script kiddies looking for a quick score.

  

Their proof of stake came wrapped in flesh.

  

No complex exploits needed. No private keys required. These kidnappers needed to prove they weren't bluffing.

  

So they sent Balland's severed finger along with their demands – the kind of message that needs no decryption.

  

**In the world of hardware wallets, your seed phrase is your ultimate backup. In the world of flesh and blood, there are no restore options.**

  

_In a game where fingers are collateral, who dares to call bluff?_

  

### Mixed Signals

  

_As [rumors swirled](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/ledger-cofounder-david-balland-and-wife-kidnapped-in-france/) through crypto Twitter like a meme coin pump, some stayed silent, understanding that in kidnapping cases, social media engagement could be paid for in blood._

  

**Even Ledger's CEO Pascal Gauthier kept quiet, [later explaining](https://x.com/_pgauthier/status/1882505648161583609) their priority was letting law enforcement work without compromising the operation.**

  

Initial reports [mistakenly claimed Éric Larchevêque](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_) was the victim – a reminder that in crypto, even verification can be compromised.
  
Even as observers debated whether the kidnapping was real, French authorities were already executing their response.

  

They knew in kidnapping cases, public speculation could cost lives.

  

Law enforcement moved with the precision of a well-executed smart contract.

  

_A [stolen car here](https://x.com/PixOnChain/status/1882835803740704798), a [traced phone there](https://x.com/PixOnChain/status/1882835803740704798) - each lead bringing them closer to their targets._

  

**To buy time and track the criminals, [investigators sent 1 BTC](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_) ($105,000) – a transaction fee that would make even Ethereum L1 blush.**

  

But this heist was about to hit a hard stop.

  

Law enforcement moved faster than a zero-day exploit.

  

[230 operators from GIGN](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_) – one of the world's elite lethal special forces units – deployed across France.

  

The first breakthrough came in Châteauroux. There they [found Balland – alive](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_), minus one finger, plus a lifetime of trauma.

  

**[His wife surfaced hours later](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/01/24/les-kidnappeurs-du-cofondateur-de-ledger-et-de-sa-compagne-interpelles-apres-une-gigantesque-chasse-a-l-homme-sept-personnes-deferees_6512799_4408997.html?_staled_), bound in a car trunk south of Paris. [One rescue complete](https://x.com/PixOnChain/status/1882835858153521217), one life saved, zero casualties.**

  

_What happens when kidnappers leave a paper trail?_

  

### Proof of Rescue

  

_While GIGN handled the ground war, another battle was unfolding in the digital realm._

  

**[Nicolas Bacca](https://x.com/NicoBcca), another Ledger co-founder, wasn't building hardware wallets anymore.**

  

He was [crafting something new](https://www.thebigwhale.io/article/nicolas-bacca-nous-avons-invente-un-modele-dorganisation-unique-pour-intervenir-dans-les-rancons-en-cryptomonnaies) – a weapon against crypto kidnappers.

  

"My goal was to create a system that could send freeze requests to all possible platforms within minutes, not hours," Bacca explained. "I worked to establish a process that could be triggered quickly and in a coordinated manner."

  

The [squad assembled](https://en.thebigwhale.io/article-en/nicolas-bacca-we-have-invented-a-unique-organisational-model-for-intervening-in-cryptocurrency-ransomware) like an elite rescue team.

  

Sarah Compani brought her Tether connections and exchange network. SEAL 911's rapid response unit stood ready. Even Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino personally stepped in to accelerate the process.

  

_The moment Balland was secure, they executed._

  

**Each player hit their mark. Each target identified. Each escape route cut off.**

  

Documents that normally took days? Minutes.

  

Compliance checks that usually took hours? Seconds.

  

The operation moved faster than your favorite L2's block time.

  

_The score? [95% of the ransom was frozen](https://x.com/gregory_raymond/status/1882523424049787275). [Seven criminals caged](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250125-french-police-arrest-seven-after-brutal-kidnapping-of-cryptocurrency-entrepreneur). One blueprint for fighting back when crypto turns violent._

  

**A [48-hour manhunt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/01/25/the-100m-wrench-attack-how-crypto-millionaires-became-crime-targets/) ended on January 23rd with the recovery of the entrepreneur, but the trail of violence remained.**

  

According to prosecutors, [most of the suspects were already known to police](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20250125-french-police-arrest-seven-after-brutal-kidnapping-of-cryptocurrency-entrepreneur) for past criminal activities, but none had previously been involved in gang-related crime.

  

Balland survived, minus a finger but plus a dark truth – in 2025's crypto game, your wealth isn't just encrypted, it's a target painted in blood.

  

_In 2020, David Balland posted a photo of his new house, a [flex most would think nothing of](https://x.com/PixOnChain/status/1882835718315364472)._

  

**What seemed like innocent boasting may have since become a dangerous signal to those lurking in the shadows.**

  

The signs were there. In just the last month, crypto's predators in Europe have been circling with increasing boldness.

  

In Saint-Genis-Puilly, a [56-year-old father was beaten and bound](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/faits-divers-justice/un-homme-retrouve-ligote-dans-le-coffre-d-une-voiture-interceptee-par-la-police-pres-du-mans-deux-hommes-en-fuite-7958611) during a home invasion, his wife tied up while kidnappers drove him 500km away.

  

Police found him in a car trunk at a gas station near Le Mans, doused in gasoline, while his Dubai-based crypto influencer son received ransom demands.

  

_In Troyes, a 30-year-old crypto entrepreneur was [lured to a business meeting](https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/info-jdd-troyes-un-autre-entrepreneur-en-cryptomonnaies-enleve-quatre-suspects-interpelles-154239) on Rue Lamartine, only to find four kidnappers demanding €20,000 for his life._

  

**In Belgium, a crypto millionaire's wife [was dragged into a French-registered van in broad daylight](https://www.sudinfo.be/id931700/article/2024-12-21/course-poursuite-infernale-kidnappee-isabelle-epouse-dun-crypto-millionnaire-ete), saved only by a police helicopter chase that ended in a dramatic highway takedown near Bruges.**

  

When reached out for comment on this investigation, [Nicolas Bacca's](https://x.com/BTChip) words cut straight to the bone.

  

"David's only mistake was being friends with someone well-known in crypto," he noted grimly. "Given the size of our community, anyone can become a target. Crypto crime that crosses into the physical world is a guaranteed way to get rekt."

  

Our "[Surviving Digital Danger](https://rekt.news/surviving-digital-danger/)" playbook warned about the evolution of crypto predators.

  

Now a co-founder's severed finger writes the next chapter.

  

**Your wealth might be encrypted, but your existence isn't. Each bull run adds names to target lists, trading privacy for profit until flesh meets steel.**

  

_Is your opsec ready for the world we've created?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)






_Balland survived his dance with crypto's dark side, but at what cost?_

  

**He might be giving high fours for a while for starters.**

  

When flesh meets steel, no amount of cryptography can save you.

  

Your private key means nothing when a blade's at your throat.

  

_At least Balland kept his sense of humor and seemed determined to laugh through the pain._

  

**[His Twitter profile](https://x.com/Morveus) now reads "Kidnapping Championship 2025 - Ledger co-founder - Fingers: 9/10".**

  

But behind that dark joke lies a darker truth – some scars don't show up on X-rays.

  

Events like this leave wounds that no blockchain can heal.

  

**Those who once mocked anonymous founders might be rethinking their stance. After all, you can't torture a ghost.**

  

_When success puts a target on your back, what’s the cost of privacy when it’s no longer a choice?_
