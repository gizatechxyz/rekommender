_$60M gone and it barely raises an eyebrow…_

**[AlphaPo](https://alphapo.net/), a crypto payments processor for gambling platforms, lost $60M across ETH, TRON and BTC over the weekend.**

The initial figure, [reported](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1682941291825627137) by ZachXBT, sat at $23M before a [further](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448) $37M were traced and added to the total yesterday.

_Hypedrop, who rely on AlphaPo, have suspended deposits and have [reassured](https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1683818126608158720) users that withdrawals will eventually be paid out, but declined to mention the hack._

**Both the attack type and pattern of transactions post-hack [point](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448) to a certain set of state-sponsored cybercriminals:**

>This hack appears to likely have been done by Lazarus as they create a very distinct fingerprint on-chain.

**It’s been a while since we’ve seen a centralised platform’s hot wallet drained…**

_[Lazarus](https://rekt.news/big-phish/) must have been focusing their efforts [elsewhere](https://rekt.news/atomic-wallet-rekt/)._

_Could this be the start of another CEX spearphishing spree?_

**As ever, stories of compromised hot wallets leave little to be said. The phishing techniques used by sophisticated groups like Lazarus are [varied and ever-evolving](https://rekt.news/big-phish/).**

_But they alway have a common goal…_

On Ethereum, the attack begun when AlphaPo’s hot wallet ([alphapo.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6dfc34609a05bc22319fa4cce1d1e2929548c0d7)) began to be drained in the early hours (UTC) of Saturday.

[2464 ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd77012e22dbf51aceb4b759db83ef767af165c258d1c423187a6f10324d1d064) ($4.6M) and a [variety](https://etherscan.io/address/0x040a96659fd7118259ebcd547771f6ecb9580d17#tokentxns) of other coins (including over 6M USDT) were transferred to the [hacker’s address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x040a96659fd7118259ebcd547771f6ecb9580d17), swapped to ETH, were then [consolidated](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf78c52dbb2a7ac33862b6203f4af7138a8561d7fc46b6c00ec51d7f7f818446f) into a secondary [account](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6d2e8a20b8afa88d92406d315b67822c01e53c38) before being [dispersed](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1683879092913942531). Some of the stolen funds on Tron were [sent to CEXs](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1683790499352805377).

According to [ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448) the movement of funds on-chain (tracked in this [dashboard](https://dune.com/tayvano/alphapo)) have a strong correlation with [patterns](https://dune.com/tayvano/dprk-txns) associated with the Lazarus group.

[MistTrack’s analysis](https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1684173782951264262) of the wallets involved have shown links to addresses involved in the draining of Atomic Wallet accounts (also attributed to Lazarus) and a potential, but as yet acknowledged, [attack](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1683862886777516033) on Coinspaid.

**A $60M hack would have topped the rekt.news [leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) up until the mammoth [Poly Network exploit](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) in August of 2021.**

_But nowadays, such blips are in and out of the news cycle in the blink of an eye._

Are we simply becoming desensitised to such large losses?

Or are we just getting increasingly apathetic as the bear market drags on?

**Or, perhaps, the only ones still here too busy either building or hamster racing to notice.**

_One thing’s for sure, Lazarus isn’t getting bored._
