_A non-stop rug factory._

While [SBF's trial](https://rekt.news/bulls-behind-bars/) occupies the attention of the crypto hivemind, it's [business as usual](https://rekt.news/?tag=BSC) on BSC…

**$2.79M has been rugged already this week across two BSC-based shitcoin projects.**

In the early hours (UTC) of Monday, Lucky Star Currency withdrew funds from two of its own contracts, netting $1.11M.

Then, on Tuesday afternoon (UTC), FSL token followed up by dumping pre-minted tokens to drain the coin’s $1.68M of liquidity.

**The unverified FSL token [contract](https://bscscan.com/address/0x8923881e8cae6684c2bb84d69ae88a9bbbec8d5a#code) was less than 24 hours old.**

_Aren’t we supposed to be in the depths of a bear market?_

_Who’s still apeing into this stuff?_

Launched in July, Lucky Star Currency is a Chinese Astrology-themed NFT project promoted under the handle [AstrAstrol75591](https://twitter.com/AstrAstrol75591) on Twitter. The two attacked contracts, however, were published just over two weeks ago.

**The project’s deployer [address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x9ef72ee68a7c841986a0c60e0fdbae4e27446deb) used the privileged function withdrawToken() to first [drain 1.65M LSC tokens](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x67e0200a33004ca22f3df38a618389a77e35f8fe65d28d0527331a604b0a04a8) from the project’s [AwardCentre](https://bscscan.com/address/0xae3da67ed09723343fc6a93adfda44237dcf3f8d) contract, then a [further 1.45M LSC](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xcdfa6e7c061d9cbebf41c36ee9b31bf29ebba3399b18c3c0f1984580c4275581) from the [NFTMerge](https://bscscan.com/address/0x409f8c7534f484b6ac8b10b6f52bf37407d04123) contract.**

_The ~3M LSC were then [swapped](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xca0ef4214ed18b846228358a0c1fa4c315bd03fb281385d8b186e8a506df958e) for $1.1M BSC-USD and [forwarded](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x387734a093f1d5bf2ad0b85c91c951273ffbf64e33c4827b9a22b004567e205f) onto a [new address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x23f8c805306bf27ab8bf3cebece4b778acffd896), where they remain._

_An english-language [message](https://t.me/LSCNFT/15464) in the project’s Telegram group appears to play off the rug as a hack, and suggests a relaunch of new contracts._

**With less than 24 from launch to rug, there’s little to be said about FSL.**

During the token contract creation [transaction](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd3ed4cf5c276ba51845b11b10e61eafcb2dbb2e14a492662cfd18ebbc1b7caa0), the [deployer](https://bscscan.com/address/0x281b8cb2AE64cd14501fc7Bcd2545be2836B173D) minted themself 100M FSL tokens. 97M of these were then [transferred](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb30141bbc78d1455d53def7aa198e556540c9534c82575601e32fa50a0077ecb) to another [address](https://bscscan.com/address/0x7249b903da533358c897784438b87bc94b402352), which [dumped](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x792515002eaeb73da6ca36b535ae50b3e95c69b74c1a39beea90ff31c2bed5c1) the tokens for $1.68M BSC-USD.

_The proceeds were quickly swapped for 7952.2 BNB, which were [deposited](https://bscscan.com/advanced-filter?fadd=0x7249b903da533358c897784438b87bc94b402352&tadd=0x0D5550d52428E7e3175bfc9550207e4ad3859b17&txntype=0&qt=1&p=1) into Tornado Cash._

**Since its [inception](https://rekt.news/bsc-the-bridge-to-defi/), BSC has been a hotbed of fask forks, [shitcoins](https://rekt.news/shitcoins/) and rug pulls, a [semi-centralised](https://rekt.news/bnb-bridge-rekt/) DeFi-lite for a DYOR-averse userbase.**

_Even during the writing of this article, another two BSC-based projects have rugged: [Islamic Coin](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1712045559538987405) (for $150k) and [Marble X](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1712021573505618239) (for $160k)._

With FUD at an all-time high, regulatory [pressure](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/10/hamas-linked-crypto-accounts-frozen-by-israeli-police-with-binances-help-report/) and investigations [mounting up](https://rekt.news/grudgematch-sec/), it seems there’s no such thing as good press right now for Binance.

_How long will CZ continue to weather the storm?_
