**It’s shaping up to be a [big week](https://twitter.com/RhoRider/status/1706359155358044600).**

_Two crypto platforms rekt already… and that was just Monday._

**Yesterday, Justin Sun [announced](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706311251024822748) a $7.9M hack on [HTX](https://twitter.com/HTX_Global) (formerly Huobi), less than 12 hours after Mixin Network admitted to a [$200M loss](https://rekt.news/mixin-rekt/).**

In a thread oozing with His Excellency’s typical arrogance, Sun brushed off the loss as a drop in the ocean compared to the $3B of assets held on the platform, also noting the stolen amount represents “_just two weeks' revenue_” for the exchange.

**In an amusing case of [foreshadowing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-21/in-justin-sun-s-huobi-rebrand-to-htx-there-are-echoes-of-ftx), the hack comes just after Huobi rebranded to HTX. Sounds eerily similar to [disgraced SBF](https://rekt.news/sbf-mask-off/)’s now bankrupt exchange, doesn’t it?**

Sun [claimed](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706328353555521603) (somewhat implausibly) not to have noticed the similarity, after CZ wasted no time in [poking fun](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1706326077021274327) at the irony.

_What do they say about people in [glass houses](https://rekt.news/grudgematch-sec/) again?_

**First [FTX](https://rekt.news/ftx-yikes/), then 3AC’s [GTX](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558653/crypto-three-arrows-capital-bankrupt-gtx-exchange), now HTX…**

_Do we really have to get to ZTX before we hit the bottom?_

**As often is the case with hacks of centralised exchanges, details of the attack vector are scant.**

The 4999 ETH ($7.9M) was [drained](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe9eefff04322a1e9262aad139e7b03954709a7c2ffea5ba9d1026a24fb58c029) at 10AM UTC on Sunday, with the remaining 633 ETH (worth $1M) [secured](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x413f7f78b1d49b3163e0402444e9cb3b0c318a57b8d5102679e07f83ae3d114d) by HTX just over two hours later.

Attacker addresses:

**[0xdb1D74467c9042517A354304256E0d658D8AEC83](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdb1D74467c9042517A354304256E0d658D8AEC83)**

**[0x799982b75Ba538F211871cBa50Fa1A42ADa9ab5E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x799982b75Ba538F211871cBa50Fa1A42ADa9ab5E)**

It seems strange that all funds were not drained, and that, if HTX were immediately aware of the incident (_as Sun [claims](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706313333782008014)_), that the rescue of the leftovers took so [long](https://twitter.com/YannickCrypto/status/1706340853122228475).

Sun also says that the hacker has been identified (_[why not prove it?](https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1706316658803978597)_) and has extended an offer [on-chain](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc3ca45c0f1d78651f586a9bfeb8fd246fe1a8bee104889087274ad0d6b081347) of 5% bounty, [and a job](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706317854851694781), valid for seven days after which law enforcement will be informed.

Despite the initial downplaying, Sun followed up with a [thread](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706535168406896866) announcing livestreams to talk exchange security. The thread also [states](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706535349831545040):

>we have implemented real-time monitoring mechanisms to prevent such losses.

**You’d have thought an exchange holding $3B in user assets (as Sun claims) would already have this kind of system in place, right?**

But given that Sun tends to use Huobi to YOLO mind-boggling sums of crypto around on a daily basis (_presumably part of his duties as some kind of [self-proclaimed crypto superhero](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1704792191451988316)_), such a system might have set off alarm bells a little too often.

**There appears to be a sudden wave of bad news coming out of the asian crypto markets recently.**

Yesterday [Mixin](https://rekt.news/mixin-rekt/) topped the 2023 [leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/). Before that, another HK exchange, JPEX, [abandoned ship](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1702337163290099998) following a [warning](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1701901847156711892) from the regulators, and Upbit fell for a [fake token top-up scam](https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1706594965101687076).

To top it off, Tether is [dismissing rumours](https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1706263233928061126) of trouble in Singapore as FUD, but _someone_ looks to be trying to [get rid](https://twitter.com/napgener/status/1706340498154123481) of USDT.

**Will this $7.9M drop in the ocean turn out to be a simple case of ‘4’ for Huobi?**

_Or are there [bigger things](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1706329246778413559) to come?_
