**rekt across thirteen chains.**

_Is that a new record?_

**CEX [CoinEx](https://twitter.com/coinexcom/) has become the latest crypto custodian to have its hot wallets emptied, losing an eventual total of $54.3M.**

They may want to update their [homepage](https://www.coinex.com/en/):

>Secure and safeguarded with 0 incident

Approximately four hours after the attack [began](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb6a07c2c591e43abc63add833aaf4d6ab47e66f05cf6b49a9dda7c2317b2d61c), CoinEx [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/coinexcom/status/1701645979798409223) the incident (_though the thread has since been deleted and [replaced](https://twitter.com/coinexcom/status/1701651414991397176) with a more urgent sounding message_).

**Presumably, letting users know they have a “_special investigative team_” on the case didn’t cut the mustard…**

CoinEx assures users that the missing coins make up “_just a very small portion of CoinEx’s total asset_”, and that losses will be covered. Deposits and withdrawals are currently suspended.

As with last week’s $40M+ [Stake hack](https://rekt.news/stake-rekt/), the alarm was raised by [Cyvers](https://twitter.com/CyversAlerts/status/1701592552351359106), who flagged the suspicious outflows. The Stake incident was later [attributed](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-identifies-lazarus-group-cyber-actors-as-responsible-for-theft-of-41-million-from-stakecom) to DPRK state-sponsored hackers by the FBI.

**Could this be twice in two weeks for [Lazarus](https://rekt.news/big-phish/)?**

**The attack began with a [transfer](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb6a07c2c591e43abc63add833aaf4d6ab47e66f05cf6b49a9dda7c2317b2d61c) of almost 4950 ETH (worth approximately $8M) at 1:20:59 PM UTC.**

As in previous examples, wallets were then rapidly drained of ETH/TRON/MATIC followed by other assets, which in turn were swapped back to native assets over the following hours and [forwarded](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1701832960805368171) onto new addresses.

CoinEx have not announced how the security breach occurred, but [stated](https://twitter.com/coinexcom/status/1701651414991397176) they will publish a report in due course:

>You have our solemn promise that a detailed timeline and comprehensive report about this incident will be shared with the community as swiftly as possible.

_Funds that remained in CoinEx hot wallets appear to be being accumulated in a [multisig address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf54635836862aad6e255e9b4fe49275fa5047e5d) (current holdings of over $70M)._

**As more wallets were identified, and the losses stacked up, some of the associated addresses were linked to [exchanges](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1701786126787485985) and [Twitter accounts](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1701791431399281136).**

But with for-sale KYC’d accounts and outsourced scamfarms [common](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1678534888079671297) among organised cybercriminals, it’s rare that these kinds of links lead to any material consequences.

**However, one [OP address](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x75497999432b8701330fb68058bd21918c02ac59) was identical to a [MATIC address](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x75497999432b8701330fb68058bd21918c02ac59) used during last week's [Stake casino heist](https://rekt.news/stake-rekt/).**

While much of the crypto crowd has grown apathetic over the last few months, [Lazarus has been busy](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1701955484885098881), and shows no signs of slowing down.

**With danger lurking around every corner of the cryptosphere, CEXs purport to offer a safe haven which users can trust to safely hold their assets, rather than risk [getting rekt on-chain](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/).**

But is it that cases of compromised keys so frequent on centralised exchanges holding hundreds of millions in user assets?

As we said [last week](https://rekt.news/stake-rekt/):

>...centralised platforms should be held to a higher standard.

_How long until the next CEX is hit?_
