_The sandwicher has become the sandwiched._

**$2M was lost on Tuesday night as an MEV bot got a taste of its own medicine.**

The curious case of crypto-karma was spotted by [Spreek](https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1722040126614761790), who identified the issue as an unprotected swap function within the bot’s code.

The incident is reminiscent of when the notorious bot [0xbadc0de](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a) got [rekt for $1.5M](https://rekt.news/ripmevbot/), last year.

As we wrote at the time:

>MEV bots act on the boundary of “code is law”.

When it comes to autonomous on-chain predators it’s hard to sympathise.

_Is this a simple case of ‘you win some, you lose some’?_

**For all the complexity within the dog-eat-dog world of MEV, the exploit was surprisingly simple.**

The bot’s code had left a swap function unprotected, which anyone could call. This was exploited to sandwich attack the bot via WETH/WBTC trades on Curve, funded via a $50M flash loan.

BlockSec [explains](https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1722101942061601052):

>A bot was attacked due to the lack of access control of a public function 0xf6ebebbb, which could be exploited to manipulate swaps in Curve pools. The loss was ~$2M.
>
>Hence the attacker could first abuse the flawed function to pump the asset price (e.g., WETH) and then make a reverse swap to make a profit.

**Whenever large amounts of money move in DeFi, things tend to work out nicely for Curve (_though [not always](https://rekt.news/curve-vyper-rekt/)_), and this incident was no exception.**

The swapping of vast sums necessary to imbalance the pool enough for a viable exploit generated a cool [$250k in fees](https://twitter.com/CurveCap/status/1722231234259238950) for the protocol.

[0xc0ffeebabe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0ffeebabe5d496b2dde509f9fa189c25cf29671), another bot known for the occasional [whitehat](https://rekt.news/curve-vyper-rekt/) exploit-frontrun, also made an [appearance](https://twitter.com/CurveCap/status/1722231231813988491) in cleaning up the mess.

**Autonomous bots, while constantly controversial, seem to be a necessary evil of a permissionless financial system.**

And with the juicy tips often paid to validators, many of the ecosystem’s key players are surely happy to tolerate the activities of the [Dark Forest](https://rekt.news/return-to-the-dark-forest/)’s most dangerous predators.

_How long until you fall prey, anon?_
