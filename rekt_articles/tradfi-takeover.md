_The vultures are circling._

An industry weakened by a series of crises, regulatory aggression and tough macro conditions is becoming a prime target for those who missed their chance last cycle.

**Blackrock, Citadel and Deutsche Bank are among the big names making big moves this week.**

**2021’s bull market saw crypto gain mainstream attention, turning old money from sceptics into scavengers.**

_But by the time [meme coins](https://rekt.news/fomo-on-meme-street1/) began to make headlines, their entry point was long gone._

**Now, instinct tells them to [strike](https://twitter.com/zackvoell/status/1671302692898217984) when their prey is at its most vulnerable.**

A TradFi takeover is the natural culmination of a non-stop assault since the [FTX blow-up](https://rekt.news/ftx-yikes/), an [implosion](https://rekt.news/meltdown/) in crypto-friendly banking, and now [Gensler’s](https://rekt.news/grudgematch-sec/) regulation-by-enforcement approach against top CEXs and tokens.

After [years](https://rekt.news/stable-coins-the-empire-strikes-back/) of dismissing, attacking and ridiculing a tool which threatened the status quo, traditional finance is now swooping in.

_Will crypto remain an alternative system?_

_Or simply be co-opted as TradFi infrastructure?_

**With crypto’s larger players either out of the way or on the back foot, the window of opportunity is wide open.**

Names like [Kwon](https://rekt.news/luna-rekt/), [Celsius](https://rekt.news/celsius-rekt/), [3AC](https://rekt.news/three-arrows/) and [SBF](https://rekt.news/sbf-mask-off/) have tarnished the industry’s reputation, and SEC action against Coinbase and Binance have put them on the defensive.

_Now is the perfect time for established players to get in on a sector that they previously turned their backs on._

The first hints came during the recent Financial Services Committee [hearing](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408851) on The Future of Digital Assets, and the appearance of Prometheum.

Coming across as a political plant presenting a compliance wet dream, the CEO [parroted](https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1668747275550740482) talking points on stablecoins and banking, despite the company’s focus being a [contradictory](https://twitter.com/RSSH273/status/1668602504328904707) securities exchange.

Perhaps Prometheum isn’t all that interested in listing existing assets, but rather prepping the ground for a slew of TradFi tokens (including [their own](https://twitter.com/MattWalshInBos/status/1669061644377268228)) over the coming months and years?

_But with Prometherum’s [background](https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143092274888704), they sure seem an odd pick for the SEC's poster boy._

**Since then, Blackrock filed with the SEC for a [Bitcoin](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/blackrock-close-filing-bitcoin-etf-coindesk-2023-06-15/) ETF (proposing Coinbase as custodian), with [WisdomTree](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-20/wisdomtree-files-for-us-spot-bitcoin-etf-on-heels-of-application-by-blackrock), and then [Valkyrie](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841175/000138713123007682/valkyrie-s1a_062123.htm) following suit.**

Citadel has been gearing up for some time, but the exchange it backed has finally [launched](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/new-crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-and-citadel-launches/) (hopefully they’re not taking [inspiration](https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1480891960722223105) from FTX and Alameda).

Even Deutsche Bank is [getting in](https://investor-relations.db.com/files/documents/other-presentations-and-events/2023/20230620-David-Lynne-at-dbAccess-Conference-Transcript.pdf) on the action, applying for a digital asset license and discussing the branding potential of NFTs.

**In fact, over half of Fortune 100 companies have explored crypto in some way since 2020, [according](https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1671868567640260609) to Coinbase and The Block.**

The industry is still seen as being in its infancy, however, and TradFi’s [dismissive attitude](https://www.theblock.co/post/233561/soros-fund-management-ceo-crypto) is still strong:

>It’s clear these crypto native platforms would have benefitted from having an adult in the room.

**But that won’t get in the way when there’s money to be made…**

_…and, to be honest, she might have a point._

Giga-rekt failed hedge funders [Zhu and Davies](https://rekt.news/three-arrows/) recently announced that OPNX, their new CEX set up to leverage their intimate knowledge of bankruptcy claims, would be [working alongside](https://twitter.com/cryptoxuzi/status/1671514486082002946) an “_ecosystem partner_” called… 3AC Ventures.

The tone-deaf grandstanding came whilst the exchange was simultaneously proving completely [amateur](https://twitter.com/0xLoris/status/1671679466668453889) at faking volume via wash trading, as well as launching justice tokens to memecoin-ify [lawsuits](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/22/opnx-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-mike-dudas-issues-justice-tokens/).

_While TradFi piles in, various US regulatory bodies battle over who gets to control crypto and mould the industry into something more [Wall St-friendly](https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1672001373594873858)._

**Having mainly been the domain of the CFTC and SEC, now the Fed is throwing its hat into the ring.**

**By [accepting](https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1671540189091487747) that stablecoins are “_a form of money_”, Powell goes on to then claim jurisdiction over their regulation.**

Private companies issuing national currency is a concept which few could have imagined a generation ago, and one that makes the established system very uncomfortable.

The Fed recognising the validity of such a key part of our infrastructure is both encouraging and troubling…

As we [wrote](https://rekt.news/meltdown/) after March’s USDC depeg:

>The thought of a CBDC becoming the ultimate tool for nightmarish surveillance and control is a [truly terrifying prospect](https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/just-say-no-to-cbdcs).

TradFi is even looking at DeFi with interest, with Uniswap’s forthcoming v4 [seen](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/blackrock-exec-says-tokenisation-of-stocks-will-be-slow/) as a potential way to create permissioned pools for KYC’d addresses.

**Soon, there may be [nowhere to hide](https://rekt.news/eye-of-the-storm/).**

As both TradFi and regulators make their mark on the industry, leading to an ever more watered-down version of crypto’s original goal…

_…will DeFi be forced to [go dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA3YZVDUN5s)?_
