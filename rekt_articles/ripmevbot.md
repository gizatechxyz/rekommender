**Zero pity.**

The notorious MEV bot known as [0xbad](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a) has fallen on hard times, just like the rest of us.

After 75 days of exploiting value from unexpecting users, this mempool menace backfired on its owner, creating a beautiful display of on-chain karma.

After one unfortunate user tried to [swap $1.85M of Compound cUSDC for USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x96a129768ec66fd7d65114bf182f4e173bf0b73a44219adaf71f01381a3d0143) on Uniswap v2, a lack of liquidity meant they only received $500 in USDC. 0xbad was quick to profit from the swap, backrunning the trade with an [elaborate arb](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2a615005a63785284f11a4c5cb803d1935d34e358c10a3b4d76398d2e7bb2f9d) involving many different DeFi dApps.

$1.02M profit.

**Nice.**

*However…*

**0xbad got put down… _tremendously_.**

An anonymous attacker noticed a flaw in the bots arbitrage contract code, and [stole](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x631d206d49b930029197e5e57bbbb9a4da2eb00993560c77104cd9f4ae2d1a98) not only the recently acquired 800 ETH, but the entire 1,101 ETH in 0xbad’s wallet.  

**Attacker’s address: [0xb9f78307ded12112c1f09c16009e03ef4ef16612](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9f78307ded12112c1f09c16009e03ef4ef16612)**

**0xbad: [0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a)**  

[@bertcmiller](https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1574852628030361609?s=20&t=UMyyYEHWlz88vonCknKWUA) of Flashbots broke it down:

0xbad did not properly protect the function that they used to execute the dYdX flashloans.

Note "callFunction," which is the function called by the dYdX router as a part of flashloan execution

**When you get a flashloan the protocol you're borrowing from will call a standardized function on your contract.**  

In this case dYdX called "callFunction" on 0xbad.

Unfortunately for 0xbad, their code allowed for arbitrary execution.  

The attacker used this to get 0xbad to [approve all of their WETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x59ddcf5ee5c687af2cbf291c3ac63bf28316a8ecbb621d9f62d07fa8a5b8ef4e) for spender on their contract.

The attacker then simply [transferred the WETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x631d206d49b930029197e5e57bbbb9a4da2eb00993560c77104cd9f4ae2d1a98) out to their address.

_Down 0xbad_

**To add further drama to the drama, 0xbad decided to try and threaten their attacker with a [message sent](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6352ab3619bf078efd19272fc425fefd19e0e9081ce0019a72afadf2ff0a2c41) via transaction input data.**

**Last year, in “Return to the Dark Forest”, we wrote:** 

>Frontrunning is vampiric. It feeds off weaker participants, while conflicts with other bots push gas prices to unusable levels. Most of the time, frontrunners win…

_But not this time…_

**MEV bots act on the boundary of “code is law”.** 

_In the PvP arena that is Ethereum’s Dark Forest, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose._

Despite the fact that the funds were never returned to their original owner, it’s nice to see such a prompt display of on-chain karma.

As Bert Miller wrote on Twitter:

_Bad code, great content_

**Which would make a great tagline for rekt.news…**
