_Another day, another rug pull. This time on Coinbase's pet project Base Network._  
  
**ETHTrustFund rug pulls on Base, leading to $2.1 million in investor losses.**

  

Every ponzi needs a catchy name and what better way to inspire trust than by including "ETH" and "Fund" in your project title?  
  
It turned out to be anything but trustworthy.  
  
Users deposited their hard-earned ETH directly into the project's treasury without realizing they were funding an exit scam.  
  
**The dev, known only as Peng, spent months building trust and raising capital, before ghosting investors for three months and finally pulling the rug.**

  

_Doesn’t this look like it was a personal trust fund for the developer?_

**With a well-funded treasury of over $2 million, ETHTrustFund aka [ETF](https://dexscreener.com/base/0x4b8a4fabe047ff800a7fe4984ac1bd3458067255), positioned itself as an OHM fork on Base.**

Investors believed the founder to be a seasoned dev, willing to build a legitimate project on the new chain.  
  
To outsiders, it looked like a token that pumped and dumped back in March, after pumping shortly after launching, it was down over 90% less than a week later.  
  
_After months of inactivity, the price stagnated. Then came the inevitable._

**Crypto crime fighter Ogle from [glue.net](http://glue.net) called out the project [for rugging over this past weekend](https://x.com/cryptogle/status/1814785746030440522) and [reported it to Chainabuse](https://www.chainabuse.com/report/4e3e0656-698b-4e09-a561-e470c53375e4).**  
  
The fraudulent project abruptly moved funds from its treasury to a new wallet.  
  
Crypto community figure Octoshi [disclosed a series of suspicious funds transfers](https://x.com/0ctoshi/status/1815026461675335752) and the project’s sudden inactivity.  
  
The founder, Peng, had deleted his Telegram, Twitter, the official Telegram of the project itself and was ignoring all messages and DMs.

**Tracing the stolen funds:**  
  
All $BRETT tokens were swapped to $ETH and bridged from the treasury on Base to a fresh wallet on Ethereum.  
  

**ETHTrustFund deployer address:**
[0xF259F01C40C211D63Ab75A6d2B108B364EFaB780  ](https://basescan.org/address/0xf259f01c40c211d63ab75a6d2b108b364efab780)

**Treasury address:**
[0xbfDB66a6783a6Dc757f539139c68BED75EB491c8  ](https://basescan.org/address/0xbfdb66a6783a6dc757f539139c68bed75eb491c8)

**Bad actor’s address:**
[0x374f4BD39aD211e67e0f8Cb8Ebf1b4F6Ac3059aD  ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x374f4bd39ad211e67e0f8cb8ebf1b4f6ac3059ad)

**Theft Transactions:**

**3.2 million BRETT ($453k stolen on July 20):**
[Theft Transaction 1](https://basescan.org/tx/0x2a7af282f777253ae4aa43679ba79658a77c45502040ea14fcae4bb183f88091)

  _9.5 hours later…_

  
**477 ETH ($1.65 million stolen on July 21):**
[Theft Transaction 2  ](https://basescan.org/tx/0x886ef55a948dfdfdc54f5e0205abb517b2747251bc817eeadfd732fc7061d83e)

**The bad actor’s address moved 200 ETH to Railgun:**

[0x77fd5bba5ab71c7d79d5eb852a44c37213d6684d37f249efd4719aab6b5944c0  ](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x77fd5bba5ab71c7d79d5eb852a44c37213d6684d37f249efd4719aab6b5944c0)

**Shortly after, this address transferred another 200 ETH to Tornado Cash in two separate transactions:**

[0xfabb100940c9dc35f0393c895e068904fb6ed0f5955e04380f6edcc44f0fd0c2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfabb100940c9dc35f0393c895e068904fb6ed0f5955e04380f6edcc44f0fd0c2)

[0x15d8d620334eae734e2f1891005616802506940b38ede85cb628133dd9027edc](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x15d8d620334eae734e2f1891005616802506940b38ede85cb628133dd9027edc)  
  
**An additional 56.9 ETH was then funneled back to Railgun:**

[0xa9087c7458c66b0334c1dcc991503d70a0662f7043f8b95217e7cf75ec14369f](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa9087c7458c66b0334c1dcc991503d70a0662f7043f8b95217e7cf75ec14369f)

As the dust settled, users started looking for someone to blame. But "Peng" had already vanished into the crypto ether…

Social media accounts deleted, website down, only the ghostly remains of project docs were left behind, at least briefly, as those have been taken down too.  
  
All evidence pointed towards a classic rug pull/exit scam, with Base as the unwitting stage for this financial theater.  
  
**[ETHTrustFund positioned itself](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethtrustfund-dao-transfers-treasury-apparent-rug-pull?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound) as a DAO with rebasing features, following the OHM playbook.**

They issued blockchain-based bonds and implemented a "rebasing" mechanism for stakers.

  

[They bragged](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314172053/https://docs.ethtf.io/) to be the “Highest Return Yielding ETF On Earth”.  
  

_The fund promised to eventually "debase" or destroy its own ETF tokens, supposedly pushing up remaining token prices. All invested assets would allegedly generate yield for token holders._

**Turns out that was all a smokescreen and the dev may have been the only one who profited through this web of ponzinomics.**  
  

[0ctoshi urges those who were affected](https://x.com/0ctoshi/status/1815026484861382834) to [contact him on X](https://x.com/0ctoshi) and his DMs are open, all info and help is welcome.  
  
Shortly after Base launched, a project named [BALD pulled the rug](https://rekt.news/bald-rekt/) for $23 million, 3 weeks later, [Magnate Finance rugged](https://cointelegraph.com/news/magnate-finance-on-base-rug-pulls-users-of-6-5m-as-predicted-by-on-chain-sleuth) for $6.5 million.  
  
**As Base continues attracting projects and capital, it seems the L2 is speed running through some classic crypto scams.**

_Will Base ever shake off its reputation as a playground for rug pulls?_

**While Coinbase continues to tout Base as the future of DeFi, it seems the only thing truly decentralized is the distribution of scams across the network.**

  

_From BALD to ETHTrustFund, Base is building a reputation as a haven for digital highwaymen._  
  
As investors lick their wounds and Peng presumably sips Mai Tais on a beach somewhere, we're reminded that in crypto, trust is as volatile as the markets themselves.  
  

**As the L2 wars heat up, it seems Base is content to let its users serve as cannon fodder in the battle for adoption.**

  
In the race to crown the next big L2, have we forgotten that true innovation doesn't come at the cost of user security or is this just the price of admission to the future of finance?  
  
With crypto crime fighter Ogle and others on the hunt, the scammer has a target painted on their back.

  

**Hopefully they will paint themself into a corner and get caught.**  
  
_In this high-stakes game of cat and mouse, with scammers abound, is this turning into an expensive game of whack-a-mole?_
