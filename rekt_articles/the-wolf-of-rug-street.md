excerpt: Shameless Hayden Davis doesn't stop at presidents. While Argentina reels from his LIBRA rug, he launched WOLF - copying The Wolf of Wall Street - Jordan Belfort's brand with none of his finesse. Blockchain traces his cash outs while lawyers circle. Will his final rug be one he never cashes?

_Even after rugging an entire country, Hayden Davis still has no shame._

**While most scammers would retreat to the shadows after orchestrating a multi-million dollar rug pull implicating a sitting president, Davis in contrast, doubled down - proving he's more audacious than ever.**

The mastermind behind the LIBRA and MELANIA token disasters may have completed a meme coin hat trick, launching WOLF while an Argentine prosecutor pushes for an Interpol Red Notice.

From presidential endorsements to one-sided liquidity schemes, from millions in extracted value to class action lawsuits, nothing seems to slow the relentless ambition of crypto's most brazen scammer.

**The wolf isn't just at the door - he's running the henhouse, and retail traders keep lining up to get plucked.**

_As prosecutors build their case and chain sleuths expose his wallet trails, how many more tokens will Davis launch before his scheme collapses?_

**Even with an [Argentine lawyer pushing for his arrest](https://protos.com/lawyer-wants-hayden-davis-arrested-says-mileis-sister-is-libra-mastermind/), alongside an Interpol red notice and blockchain sleuths tracking his every move, Hayden Davis couldn't resist one more score.**

  

President Javier Milei's endorsement of the so-called "economic initiative" [pumped the LIBRA token to a staggering $4.5 billion market cap](https://rekt.news/libra-rugged/) before insiders [extracted approximately $107 million](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/DocumentList?docketId=QQVVXRsKLxdxrbCUYpBoEg==&display=all&courtType=New%20York%20County%20Supreme%20Court&resultsPageNum=1), leaving retail holders with a 99% loss.

  

The fallout was nuclear: presidential impeachment calls in Argentina, [class action lawsuit in New York](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/DocumentList?docketId=QQVVXRsKLxdxrbCUYpBoEg==&display=all&courtType=New%20York%20County%20Supreme%20Court&resultsPageNum=1), and a wave of chain analysis exposing the sophisticated network of wallets that funneled millions to Davis and his associates at Kelsier Ventures.

  

_Any reasonable scammer would disappear. But Davis isn't reasonable – he's ambitious._

  

**While Argentina's legal system was still processing the damage, blockchain analysts at Bubblemaps traced a suspicious new token launch back to Davis.**

  

Leveraging rumors that [Jordan Belfort – the real "Wolf of Wall Street"](https://x.com/wolfofwallst) – was planning a token, Davis apparently couldn't resist the irony.

  

The WOLF token [quickly pumped to $42 million](https://cointelegraph.com/news/libra-melania-creator-wolf-wall-street-memecoin-crashes-99) before plummeting 99%.

  

[Bubblemaps quickly linked the token back to Davis](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1900928918749626694), identifying his signature wallet patterns.

  

[Jordan Belfort has distanced himself](https://x.com/wolfofwallst/status/1902112278042046935) from the situation, claiming “zero involvement.”

  

**But with presidents disavowing him and prosecutors closing in, Davis simply moves on to the next scheme.**

  

_When you've implicated a president and rugged an entire country, what's left to prove?_

  

### From Libra to Wolf

  

_If there's one thing Hayden Davis has perfected, it's his consistency in exploiting human greed._

  

**From LIBRA to WOLF, his playbook remains unchanged.**

  

The branding shifts, the victims change, but the execution stays the same - create hype, concentrate power, and extract value while retail investors are left holding the bag.

  

The LIBRA scandal established the template: exploit political figures for legitimacy, control the majority of supply behind the scenes, and extract millions before retail investors can blink.

  

The previously launched MELANIA followed the same pattern - leveraging the incoming First Lady's name to create artificial hype, then executing the same insider extraction that has become Davis' signature.

  

_The link between these tokens wasn't just speculative; [Davis himself claimed responsibility](https://x.com/blocknewsdotcom/status/1890949526824857875), brazenly declaring himself "Javier Milei's advisor" on social media (post has since been deleted, with many others)._

  

**Then came WOLF. As legal pressure mounted and class action lawsuits piled up, Davis apparently couldn't resist the symbolism of naming his latest scheme after Wall Street's most famous fraudster.**

  

The [WOLF token launched on March 8](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1900928743667089472), quickly [pumping to a $42 million market cap](https://cointelegraph.com/news/libra-melania-creator-wolf-wall-street-memecoin-crashes-99) before following the now-familiar playbook: 82% of supply concentrated in insider hands, strategic liquidity extraction, and a devastating price collapse that left retail investors holding worthless tokens.

  

[Even wallstreetbets](https://x.com/wallstreetbets/status/1898501336901259402), with over 900k Twitter followers, amplified the scam: "Unlike other official meme coins, I'm bullish $WOLF because it's legitimate association and backing from the owners, has experienced dev team and a timeless theme."

  

That tweet remains undeleted even after the rug - a digital monument to influence without due diligence.

  

_What makes the WOLF rug particularly audacious isn't just its timing but its transparency._

  

**[Seventeen different addresses across multiple blockchains](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1900928918749626694) all traced back to a single wallet belonging to Davis – the same wallet pattern used in his previous schemes.**

  

"Why would Hayden do this?" [Bubblemaps researchers asked rhetorically](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1900928978472305096). "Maybe he thought no one would trace it back to him."

  

This underestimates both Davis' ego and the increasing sophistication of blockchain investigators.

  

While most serial scammers modify their techniques to avoid detection, Davis appears content to run the same con repeatedly, seemingly confident that a fresh batch of retail investors will always materialize to provide exit liquidity.

  

**And with each token launch, he's been proven right - so far.** 
  
_When your scams implicate world leaders and make international headlines, are legal threats just another day at the office?_

  
### Legal Heat Rising

  

_While most crypto scammers would be in hiding, Davis seems to be more concerned with checking his wallet balances than with facing legal consequences._

  

**"The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses," [stated Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbón](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/03/13/hayden-davis-javier-milei-interpol-red-notice-prosecutor-asked-judge-melania).**

  

Despite rumors on social media [claiming Davis had been listed by Interpol](https://x.com/0xCryptoBeat/status/1900949158061896121), [no such notice appears](https://x.com/Protos/status/1901641570161488307) on [Interpol's public database](https://www.interpol.int/How-we-work/Notices/Red-Notices/View-Red-Notices) as of publishing.

  

The legal wheels turn slowly, but they are turning.

  

Blockchain analysis by researchers "dethective" has [revealed that Davis continues to cash out his ill-gotten gains](https://x.com/dethective/status/1899286538619429240), moving over $1.6 million to stable assets in recent weeks.

  

_Transactions from early March show wallets associated with Davis [cashing out $900k from Kamino Finance](https://solscan.io/tx/5vVa9MprasRtbQFrfkSBgEzxmazhaxZ7ZvYp4JFdbzivE5q7vLxpBS5ZwrHyJ6zzwCuDd6BZbWuHRUUKAJ7R39oj), followed by another [$741k](https://solscan.io/tx/4scmGEo1xH6ZnSZPnR7m1VDGMqY3iR4tJpKUGWHgEXP8s5CjjcBpthXrHfmvBjnLyimJRzKA1N25SAwfv76TNQbD) conversion the next day._

  

**"I'll keep posting because there's no way they get away with zero consequences," [the researcher noted](https://x.com/dethective/status/1899286538619429240), documenting Davis' brazen financial activities.**

  

Meanwhile, Davis and his associates now [face a class action lawsuit](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/DocumentList?docketId=QQVVXRsKLxdxrbCUYpBoEg==&display=all&courtType=New%20York%20County%20Supreme%20Court&resultsPageNum=1) that was filed in New York on March 17.

  

[Burwick Law's complaint](https://x.com/BurwickLaw/status/1901811177543360551), filed on behalf of LIBRA token purchasers, alleges the defendants "orchestrated an unfair token launch, allegedly misleading purchasers and harming retail investors."

  

The case demands both compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of "unjustly obtained" profits, and even requests the court appoint a receiver to take control of Meteora's operations - a crypto exchange allegedly instrumental in facilitating the manipulated token launch.

  

_Rare Skills founder [Jeffrey Scholz isn't buying](https://x.com/Jeyffre/status/1902204881529929756) the "don't cry at the casino" excuse._

  

**Davis and his goons aren't just stealing money - they're parasites draining legitimacy that actual builders created.**

  

"You larp as 'decentralized' while running centralized scams with none of a casino's transparency or licensing," he argues.

  

As lawsuits mount, [Scholz envisions a future](https://x.com/Jeyffre/status/1902204881529929756) where crypto aspires to Swiss banking's reputation, not Zimbabwe's.

  

Instead of going to ground, Davis continues to operate in the open, methodically cashing out while legal systems struggle to coordinate across borders.

  

**Every transferred dollar suggests a man preparing contingencies, not one worried about imminent handcuffs.**

  

_How many more tokens will Davis launch before his runway finally ends?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)


_Every crypto bull run births its signature scammer._

  

**Last cycle had SBF's empire of fraud. This cycle? Hayden Davis and his grifter meme coins.**

  

The difference between Davis and Sam Bankman-Fried? Marketing budget.

  

While SBF constructed an empire of respectability with Washington connections and effective altruist camouflage, Davis operates with raw, unfiltered audacity.

  

No big PR team. No philanthropy facade. Just wallet movements and exit strategies.

  

_Last cycle gave us elaborate whitepaper scams and VCs pumping "roadmaps to nowhere."_

  

**This cycle delivered pump.fun and political meme coins - faster, leaner, more efficient wealth extraction.**

  

Davis hacked the blockchain's greatest vulnerability - human greed multiplied by FOMO - wielding a political prop and a one-sided liquidity pool where SBF needed complex corporate structures and fraudulent balance sheets.

  

The evidence piles higher with each blockchain transaction, each new token launch, each wallet trace.

  

The Argentina rug was his biggest hit, WOLF his sloppiest exit.

  

But his audacity may be his downfall. With each new scam, the walls are closing in.

  

**Davis' eventual capture seems inevitable - it may be a matter of which international law enforcement agency catches up with him first.**

  

_Will his final rug pull be the one he never gets to cash out?_
