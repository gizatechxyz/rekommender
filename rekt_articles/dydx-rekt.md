_Weekend wipeout._

**dYdX lost 40% of its v3's insurance fund ($9M) in a ‘[targeted attack](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1725926693440045389)’ involving manipulation of Yearn’s YFI token.**

One exploit, two losers…

_…not to mention YFI’s holders._
  
_Alarm bells began to ring when [YFI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yearn-finance) tanked by ~40% (after having pumped 2x in a week), wiping $200M off the token’s market cap and leaving the chart looking like a PnD memecoin._

But, despite engagement-baiting chain-checkers [jumping to conclusions](https://twitter.com/WhaleWire/status/1725754332950258062), this wasn’t a case of insiders dumping.

**The brutal price action was, in fact, caused by [liquidations](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1725772527073644604) of YFI longs looking to ride the pump on dYdX, who fell victim to what [looks](https://twitter.com/dYdX/status/1725986476943385062) suspiciously like another ‘[highly profitable trading strategy](https://rekt.news/mango-markets-rekt/)’.**

_That didn’t end well last time, [did it](https://rekt.news/avi-arrested/)?_

As it started to [become clear](https://twitter.com/Dogetoshi/status/1725913689243414689) what had happened, dYdX officially [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/dYdX/status/1725921897848914353) the damage:

>Last night about $9m from the dYdX v3 insurance fund were used to fill gaps on liquidations processed in the YFI market. The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5m in funds remaining
>
>No user funds were affected and our team is working to investigate the event

**The incident was [characterised](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1725926693440045389) as an attack by founder Antonio Juliano shortly after. A [follow-up tweet](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1725976971245469807) elaborated on what had gone on behind the scenes:**

>in the part few days $YFI open interest on dYdX spiked from $0.8m -> $67m
>
>basically all of this was driven one actor (traceable through on chain fund movements)
>
>this same actor attempted unsuccessfully to attack the dYdX $SUSHI market 2 weeks ago in a similar way
>
>$YFI OI was higher on dYdX than any other perp venue
>
>...
>
>the $YFI price crash in the spot market seems like an intentional effort by a single actor (unsure whether the same or different one) to target the large OI on dYdX. We are still in communication with CEXs to confirm their understanding of this
>
>This information strongly makes me think this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool

The team appears to be confident that they’ll track down whoever is responsible, though, [offering](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726285820620103787) bounties to anyone who can provide info, but refusing to negotiate with the exploiter themself.

_Maybe the way things worked out for Avi has given dYdX a [confidence](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726286931133452514) boost?_

**In response to the attack, dYdX have [added](https://twitter.com/dYdX/status/1725949443445309936) extra margin requirements for lower liquidity tokens.**

_However, the responses have provoked criticism for perceived [hypocrisy](https://twitter.com/napgener/status/1726295733517861149) and [skirting](https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1726340695034884493) decentralised decision-making._

**Not to worry, though, negative feedback “_[doesn’t matter](https://twitter.com/antoniomjuliano/status/1726566858466504950)_”.**

While DEX code may be a case of set-and-forget, margin and lending protocols need constant [tweaking](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Made_Here/status/1726238750642971000) in response to market conditions, and dYdX’s [coming](https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726350318794060084) pivot to a standalone chain is set to feature full decentralisation.

Governance may have its own flaws (_and [weaknesses](https://twitter.com/functi0nZer0/status/1725922016484597975)_), but decisions made behind closed doors usually don’t sit well with the community.

However, when everyone gets their own say on risk management…

_…who’s to blame when things go wrong?_
