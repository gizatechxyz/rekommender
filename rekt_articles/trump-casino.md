_Even by crypto's chaotic standards, this weekend was something else. The kind of market madness that makes the ICO boom look like a church bake sale._

  

**After Friday's news of [Gary Gensler's departure from the SEC](https://x.com/GaryGensler/status/1880349122881810941), what followed was so wild that some half-jokingly wished for the return of crypto's favorite hall monitor.**

  

While Washington's elite clinked glasses at the Inaugural Crypto Ball, [a different kind of political revolution was brewing](https://x.com/EasyEatsBodega/status/1880439446752907362) in the digital shadows.

  

Enter [the Official TRUMP token](https://dexscreener.com/solana/a8nphpcjqtqhdquk35uj9hy2ysgxfkczgunwvkd3k7vc), the weekend's unexpected kingmaker - launching at $0.20, rocketing to $70, creating and erasing billions in wealth along the way.

  

_A weekend of wealth creation that would make even the Wolf of Wall Street howl at the moon._

  

**But like all things in crypto, what goes up must come down.**

  

Sunday brought the queen's gambit - [MELANIA meme](https://dexscreener.com/solana/9dirurpjnanzhn6ts5hglouhtjrt1jgspbxnycrfz2ad) token's launch sent markets into a death spiral.

  

The timing couldn't have been more calculated - mere days before taking the oath of office.

  

**Was this one last dance as a private citizen, one final pump before the presidential duties begin?**

  

_Could this be the new normal, where memes make millionaires and politics goes permissionless?_

**Friday evening, while Washington's crypto elite were distracted by inaugural balls, incoming President Trump was working on the Art of the Deal (or the steal? Depends on who you ask…)**

  

The [bizarre late night stealth launch](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386) caught the market with its pants down.

  

As the first buy orders rolled in - $1 million here, $500,000 there from freshly funded wallets - the whispers began: this wasn't just another pump and dump.

  

The [token's trajectory](https://leviathannews.substack.com/p/trumps-crypto-playbook-memes-millions) looked like Trump Tower itself - straight up.

  

From a [$200 million market cap at launch](https://leviathannews.substack.com/p/trumps-crypto-playbook-memes-millions), TRUMP token became a black hole of liquidity, sucking capital from every corner of the crypto markets.

  

**[Ethereum bled](https://leviathannews.substack.com/p/trumps-crypto-playbook-memes-millions), dropping from $3,452 to $3,339. But Solana? [Solana was having the time of its life](https://leviathannews.substack.com/p/trumps-crypto-playbook-memes-millions), surging 25% to $276 as traders rushed to gain exposure to the latest memecoin mania.**

  

_Until it wasn't._

  

### When MELANIA Met the Market

  

_While CT transformed into a battleground of kings and pawns, Sunday unleashed fresh chaos._

  

**First Lady's [MELANIA token launch](https://x.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/1881094861279129643) sent tremors through the crypto markets that would register on the Richter scale.**

  

TRUMP token holders [watched in horror](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881107813298237811) as $7.5 billion in market cap evaporated in 10 minutes.

  

The rush to the exits made Black Friday shoppers look civilized.

  

The [carnage played out in real-time](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881107813298237811): 824,017 TRUMP holders watched their portfolios swing wildly while Solana's network bucked under the strain.

  

Phantom Wallet's [excess of over 8 million requests per minute](https://x.com/phantom/status/1881112436549599328) brought the chain to its knees, with network fees hitting an eye-watering [$35 million in a single day](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/20/solana-bags-record-daily-fees-of-35-m-amid-trump-memecoin-frenzy).

  

**The [order books told an even grimmer tale](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881107813298237811) - $352 million in sell orders crushed against just $245 million in buys in one blood-soaked hour.**

  

_Was this just the opening act of crypto's new political theater, or had the greatest fundraising tactic in history just played out in plain sight?_

  

### Does the House Always Win?

  

_As the weekend's chaos unfolded on the surface, a more calculated game played out in the shadows._

  

**World Liberty Financial (WLFI) [closed its raise at a staggering $5 billion valuation](https://leviathannews.substack.com/p/trumps-crypto-playbook-memes-millions) - larger than DeFi heavyweight Aave.**

  

The project's promise? A new breed of DeFi infrastructure wrapped in Trump's banner, complete with a governance token claiming no economic rights yet commanding overwhelming demand.

  

Then came the plot twist: Justin Sun, TRON founder and Chinese national currently under SEC investigation, [ramped his position](https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1881169556506546485) from $30 million to $75 million in the eleventh hour.

  

His timing perfect, his motives murky—was this a play for profit, influence, or something else entirely?

  

_WLFI [wrapped up its initial 20% token supply sale](https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1881164477262930130) to thunderous demand._

  

**Within hours, they announced [plans to release an additional 5% block](https://x.com/worldlibertyfi/status/1881164477262930130) "due to massive demand and overwhelming interest."**

  

The same Trump who [once declared cryptocurrencies were "based on thin air"](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) now sat at the center of crypto's greatest spectacle.

  

The irony wasn't lost on anyone: the ultimate dealmaker may have just created the ultimate deal.

  

Every favor - geopolitical, corporate, or personal - now had a token price, instantly purchasable with a few clicks.

  

Former Trump advisor [Anthony Scaramucci put it bluntly](https://x.com/Scaramucci/status/1880963775781835169): "Now anyone in the world can essentially deposit money into the bank account of the President of USA with a couple clicks."

  

**The message was clear: the gates of political crypto influence were wide open, and the money was flowing freely.**

  

_And that was just the beginning._

  

### When it Rains, it Pours

  

_The floodgates weren't just open - they'd been blown off their hinges._

  

**As the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens dominated the headlines, the market saw a smattering of copycat launches and opportunistic plays, though few reached the scale of Ryan Fournier’s bold maneuver.**

  

The Chair of Students for Trump [orchestrated a double rug-pull of a "TikTok" coin](https://x.com/UnfiltdTruth/status/1881084554368499982), walking away with over $25 million as the market cap neared $100 million.

  

The blockchain's public ledger told the tale: [Fournier controlled over 50% of the coin's supply](https://x.com/UnfiltdTruth/status/1881084554368499982), dumping his position as retail traders rushed in.

  

The weekend's feeding frenzy [brought Solana's network to its knees](https://x.com/JakeGagain/status/1881096947009986986). Dextools, Phantom, Raydium, Jupiter - nothing worked as intended.

  

_Even [USDT briefly lost its dollar peg on Solana](https://x.com/cryptobeastreal/status/1881106609583301072), dipping to $0.97 as liquidity dried up across the ecosystem._

  

**Between rapid-fire token launches and market mayhem, Solana processed an unprecedented surge of transactions.**

  

[Phantom Wallet alone](https://x.com/phantom/status/1881190197397692647) handled over $1.25 billion in volume and 10 million transactions in a single day.

  

The cost? A staggering [$35 million in network fees](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/20/solana-bags-record-daily-fees-of-35-m-amid-trump-memecoin-frenzy) - numbers that would make even the Ethereum network blush.

  

Some traders turned prophets overnight, while others got caught in the undertow.

  

_The battle for liquidity transformed crypto into a zero-sum game where every buy needed a sell, and in the end, the last buyers would lose everything._

  

**Meanwhile, [Google searches for "how to buy crypto"](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/20/google-searches-for-how-to-buy-crypto-skyrocket-as-trump-flips-the-overton-window) hit peak popularity, as countless MAGA supporters ventured into the crypto wilderness for the first time.**

  

And then came a move so perfectly choreographed it could only be Trump.

  

[World Liberty Fi](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/worldlibertyfi) marked the inauguration of America's 47th president with [symbolic purchases of $47 million](https://x.com/arkham/status/1881405460495896930) each in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

  

Even in chaos, it seems, there's always time for showmanship.

  

**The same Trump who [once declared cryptocurrencies "based on thin air"](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192) had inadvertently orchestrated crypto's strangest mass adoption event yet.**

  

_Welcome to the blockchain, normies - did you bring a helmet?_

_While CT debates the death of DeFi and the rise of political tokens, a different story might be unfolding in the shadows._

  

**Between the pumps and dumps, the memes and the madness, something more calculated could be taking shape.**

  

[Erik Voorhees nailed the surface view](https://x.com/erikvoorhees/status/1880768009108635657?s=46): "Crypto is, and has always been, 99% nonsense grifty garbage/scams/jokes, and 1% fundamental global financial system revolution."

  

But what if this weekend's chaos wasn't just another crypto casino opening its doors?

  

Behind the retail rekt, the network outages, and the copycat rugpulls, we might be witnessing the birth of something else entirely.

  

_Picture this: A hurricane devastates North Carolina. Within hours, token holders receive an airdrop for disaster relief._

  

**California wildfires rage - emergency funding flows through the blockchain instead of bureaucratic red tape.**

  

Government programs are funded directly through token sales, bypassing traditional barriers.

  

Political participation transformed from a four-year cycle into a living, breathing digital ecosystem.

  

**Not the bull run we expected, but maybe - just maybe - the treasury management tool our broken system needed.**

  

Or perhaps just another way for the powerful to fill their bags while wrapped in the American flag.

  

The game has changed, and while others see just another meme coin massacre, a few might see the first seeds of a financial revolution being planted in plain sight.

  

**The real question isn't about price action or market caps - it's about intent.**

  

_When historians chronicle crypto's political awakening, will they mark this as the moment democracy went digital, or just the weekend America's future got rugged in plain sight?_
