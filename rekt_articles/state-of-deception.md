excerpt: In the latest episode of nations going crypto, Central African Republic's president launched a meme coin that touched almost $900M - almost a 3rd of CAR's GDP. AI and hosting can't agree if it's real and copycats are racing to launch their own.

_Just when you thought the political meme coin saga couldn't get any stranger, an entire African nation decided to join the party._

  

**Just weeks after Trump's token mania, the [Central African Republic's president apparently dropped a memecoin](https://x.com/fa_touadera/status/1888722674265764017?s=46) that briefly touched almost a billion in market cap – nearly a third of the country's GDP.**

  

While Americans were glued to Super Bowl coverage, President Faustin-Archange Touadéra's verified account announced [$CAR](https://dexscreener.com/solana/bx5pazbqbuyh5yt93xcoshdka6d6vz9azbddg7ze9syh) - an ["experiment" to unite people](https://x.com/fa_touadera/status/1888722674265764017?s=46) and put the Central African Republic "on the world stage."

  

The token's trajectory matched its ambitions, [soaring from zero to almost $900 million](https://decrypt.co/305225/central-african-republic-president-meme-coin) faster than you can say "deepfake detection."

  

**But like all things in crypto that rise too fast, gravity had other plans.**

  

As [skepticism mounted and AI detectors flagged](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skepticism-high-central-african-republic-supposedly-launches-memecoin) the presidential announcement video, $CAR's market cap crashed harder than a failed state's credit rating.

  

Yet the "official" tweets kept coming, even as the [project's original website](http://car.meme/) went dark and its [social media account](https://x.com/CARMemecoinNews) got briefly suspended.

  

**Was this the dawn of state-sponsored meme coins, a sophisticated hack, or something more sinister brewing in the shadows of African politics?**

  

_In a world where presidents pump tokens and nations launch memes, who's really pulling the strings – and more importantly, who's getting rich off the chaos?_

**On February 9th, the verified account of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra dropped a bombshell: the [Central African Republic was launching its own memecoin](https://x.com/fa_touadera/status/1888722674265764017?s=46).**

  

"Today, we are launching $CAR - an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and put the Central African Republic on the world stage in a unique way."

  

The announcement raised immediate red flags. The tweet came near midnight CAR local time, written in English rather than French – the nation's official language.

  

For a president who had spent three years tweeting almost exclusively in French, the sudden language switch struck a discordant note.

  

But then [came the video](https://x.com/FA_Touadera/status/1888731407075176660) – President Touadéra himself, speaking in French, endorsing the token.

  

**The market responded with a feeding frenzy that would make a piranha blush.**

  

_When a head of state drops a meme coin in the middle of night, do you ape in first and ask questions later?_

  

### The Pump Before the Dump

  

_Launched on Solana-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, $CAR's trajectory made [Trump's meme token](https://rekt.news/trump-casino/) look like a warm-up act._

  

**Then the [token crashed 87% to a market cap of $125 million](https://decrypt.co/305225/central-african-republic-president-meme-coin) within 11 hours of its peak – though even that dead cat bounce showed more lives than most.**

  

A [presidential tweet](https://x.com/FA_Touadera/status/1888936104927052132) claiming "success" briefly resurrected the corpse, pumping it 196% to $375 million in just 30 minutes.

  

As $CAR's market cap continued its rollercoaster ride, [President Touadéra's account announced](https://x.com/FA_Touadera/status/1889023129348939976) its first "development" initiative: $50,000 worth of tokens for high school repairs.

  

The price pumped again, because in crypto, even school construction can be a tradable catalyst.

  

**The resurrection came complete with a [restored X account](https://x.com/CARMemecoinNews), [new website](https://www.carmemecoin.com/), and fresh presidential video that actually passed Deepware's detection tests. Even Lazarus would be impressed.**

  

_When a president's tweets move markets, shouldn't we make sure it's actually the president?_

  

### Could it be a Deep Fake?

  

_While the market played ping pong with millions, the authenticity meter was reading red._

  

**Two separate AI deepfake detection models [raised alarm bells](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skepticism-high-central-african-republic-supposedly-launches-memecoin) about the presidential video announcement.**

  

The Deepware detection tool's verdict? [One model flagged it as suspicious](https://scanner.deepware.ai/result/6f5f5309c3eed2d4d404dc61fd424b48e397ed41-1739144062/), while another calculated an 82% probability of AI generation.

  

Though to be fair, two other models gave it a pass – when even AI can't agree, you know we're in uncharted territory.

  

The skepticism didn't stop at the video. [The token's official X](https://x.com/CARMeme_News) account [got suspended](https://x.com/NeuralSet/status/1888951572933279935) faster than a freshman caught plagiarizing, only to be restored later.

  

**Even Namecheap, the domain provider for car.meme, [pulled the plug on "abusive services."](https://cointelegraph.com/news/skepticism-high-central-african-republic-supposedly-launches-memecoin)**

  

_If a presidential token can't keep its website online, where exactly is all that "national development" money going?_

  

### Following the Money

  

_[The token's distribution](https://www.carmemecoin.com/#tokenomics) reads like a presidential decree: 35% for country development, 25% for "creators and company," 20.7% for liquidity, 10% for charity, and 9.3% for public distribution._

  

**[On-chain analysis from Bubblemaps](https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1888901462484206050) claims the numbers match up with the published tokenomics – a rare moment of transparency in the fog of meme coin warfare.**

  

Though "matching tokenomics" and "legitimate project" share about as much overlap as a Venn diagram drawn by a three-year-old.

  

That promised 20% liquidity allocation? Still waiting to materialize like campaign promises after election day.

  

**Meanwhile, [blockchain sleuths identified wallets](https://x.com/SebastianHajdi1/status/1888915829942628614) holding 33.31% and 25% of the supply – numbers that align suspiciously well with the stated allocations for development and creators.**

  

_When presidents pitch meme coins for national development, who's actually developing what?_

  

### Copycats and Consequences  
  
_Success, even questionable success, breeds imitation._

  

**The day after $CAR's peak, a fake "verified" account of Congo's president [announced their own token launch](https://x.com/RustyNail541/status/1889016625283875077) - $[CONGO](https://dexscreener.com/solana/2h9pgnyuezjbwxlgfqmcvwgo4mgmczguq1gcffuscgpe) "aimed at supporting and advancing the prosperity of our great nation."**  
  
Whomever tried this scam wasn’t very smart, they [listed the ticker as $CONQO](https://x.com/RustyNail541/status/1889016625283875077) on their Twitter account.  
  
That did not stop people aping in for a [4 hour, $2 million pump and dump](https://dexscreener.com/solana/2h9pgnyuezjbwxlgfqmcvwgo4mgmczguq1gcffuscgpe).

  

Sadly, yet comically, the same Twitter handle used to promote the $CONGO meme scam, [@sadwraciborzu](https://x.com/sadwraciborzu), was repurposed to mimic [Nikos Christodoulides](https://x.com/Christodulides), the President of Cyprus and [promote a Cyprus National Token](https://x.com/sadwraciborzu/status/1889341561747406956).

  

The playbook was spreading faster than a meme coin listing on Pump.fun.

  

_An [Indian cabinet minister's account](https://x.com/prahladspatel) with 400,000 followers suddenly [started shilling $INDIA](https://x.com/daumeneth/status/1888971535278326214) – before quickly going private faster, than you can say "diplomatic incident."_

  

**Turns out his [Twitter was hacked](https://x.com/talyonsol/status/1889003616100569142), but the [reputational damage was already done](https://x.com/MemeseusMaximus/status/1888990930755358956).**

  

The political token circus was already in full swing.

  

Just weeks ago, Cuba's official account [launched four meme coins](https://x.com/crptAtlas/status/1881815718330843409) in succession, each one getting rugged harder than the last.

  

**The house always wins, but lately the house is masquerading as government officials.**

  

_When verified accounts start launching tokens faster than you can verify their authenticity, is this the future of national fundraising, or just the latest evolution of the classic Nigerian Prince email?_

  

### Trust Issues  
  

_While CT debated the legitimacy of presidential meme coins, a darker game was playing out in the shadows._

  

**Crypto data aggregators [found themselves hosting links to phishing sites](https://cointelegraph.com/news/car-memecoin-crypto-scam-phishing-links) masquerading as official $CAR resources.**

  

A [suspicious Telegram group](https://cointelegraph.com/news/car-memecoin-crypto-scam-phishing-links), created on February 3rd and linked across crypto platforms, went from a cryptic "ca soon" message to hosting a phishing operation with fake verification bots.

  

[Meow from Jupiter tried playing diplomat](https://x.com/weremeow/status/1888758460088795474), reaching out to "verify" the token's official status while simultaneously warning about "doubts about the lock."

  

_Their temporary verification to "[let people not buy the wrong ticker](https://x.com/weremeow/status/1888765984393347477)" felt about as reassuring as a shark offering swimming lessons._

  

**Sixteen hours after launch, with millions flowing through suspicious wallets and AI models playing pin the tail on the deepfake, still [no word came from any official CAR government channel](https://x.com/weremeow/status/1888802964497997911) outside of Twitter.**

  

The silence spoke volumes, but the money spoke louder.

  

Meanwhile, [Reuters treated the president's tweets](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-debuts-meme-coin-experiment-2025-02-10/) like they were carved in stone. No deepfake concerns, no questions about the midnight English tweets from a French-speaking president - just another day in global finance.

  

**One wonders how many traders got rekt following their headlines.**

  

_When every link leads to a trap and every verification needs verifying, are we watching the birth of state-sponsored meme coin warfare, or just getting rugged in 4K diplomatic resolution?_

_As Washington dismantles regulatory oversight and foreign aid programs face the chopping block, crypto's newest frontier is emerging in unexpected places._

  

**The timing of $CAR's launch feels less like coincidence and more like adaptation.**

  

"Africa heard USAID was shutting down the flow of funds and went to the trenches for funding - 2025 is crazy," as [one CT observer eloquently noted](https://x.com/iamjoshmoulton/status/1888800831069212958).

  

[CryptoQuant's CEO,may have inadvertently predicted the future](https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/09/heres-what-cryptos-killer-use-case-will-be-in-the-future-according-to-cryptoquant-ceo/) when declaring "PoliFi will be crypto's killer use case."  
  
_Not quite what he meant though - instead of roadmaps, treasury management and proof of reserves, we got straight to degen launches on Pump.fun._

  

**But as nation-states rush to launch tokens quicker than they can maintain websites, the real question isn't about technology – it's about power.**

  

Whether these are state-sanctioned experiments or sophisticated scammers exploiting the chaos, no one seems to know - or care, as long as the number goes up.

  

**A new kind of digital diplomacy is emerging, where national development comes with a side of tokenomics.**

  

_When traditional funding channels close and regulatory lights go dark, are we watching the birth of something revolutionary, or just getting rugged by so-called leaders instead of degens?_
