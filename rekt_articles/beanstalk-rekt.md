excerpt: $181M jacked from Beanstalk, but the attacker only kept $76M. A malicious governance proposal was pushed through by a flash loan, and the attacker then voted to transfer all the assets to themself, but not before donating $250K to the Ukraine war fund.

**$181 million jacked from Beanstalk, but the attacker only kept $76M.** 

[rekt.news](https://rekt.news/) records the damage, not the profit, so this one takes #5 on [the leaderboard.](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/)

**A malicious governance proposal was pushed through by a flash loan, and the attacker then voted to transfer all the assets to themself.**

Another ~24800 ETH into Tornado Cash, and 250K of stolen money into the Ukraine War Fund.

_How much longer can this crimewave last?_

**This was a governance attack made possible through the use of flash loans combined with the absence of a delay on proposal execution.**

The attacker temporarily acquired sufficient voting power to immediately execute a malicious emergency governance proposal, draining the protocol.

Though the attack was instant, some [preparation was needed:](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter/status/1515735717305008138)

> _â€¦there's a ~1 day delay for *all* governance actions in the $BEAN contract. The attacker actually set this whole thing up yesterday when it made two governance proposals._
>
> _The first proposal (proposal #18) steals all the money in the contract. The next proposal (proposal #19) sends $250k worth of $BEAN to the Ukraine donation address. This Ukraine proposal is *named* Bip18 (instead of Bip19)..._

**Once the delay had passed, the attack could be [executed:](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1515693895887294466)**

> The exploiter was funded from the Synapse Protocol bridge [though initially from Tornado].
>
>They used a flash loan to get:
> 
> 350M DAI, 500M USDC, and 150M USDT from Aave;
> 
> 32M BEAN from Uniswap v2;
> 
> 11.6M LUSD from SushiSwap.
> 
> These tokens were used to add liquidity to Curve pools with BEAN for the governance voting.
> 
> Further, they deployed and voted for a fake BIP-18 that moved all funds from the protocol contract to the exploiter.
> 
> The next step was removing liquidity, repaying flash loans, and converting all received funds into 24.8k WETH ($76M), which went to Tornado Cash.

**Presumably to avoid suspicion of an inside-job, Publius, the anon behind the protocol, took the decision to reveal their identity as a group of three in a [statement](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/880500642546851850/965496314244775976) published to Discord.**

Omniscia is [keen to point out](https://medium.com/@omniscia.io/beanstalk-farms-post-mortem-analysis-a0667ee0ca9d) that this attack fell outside the scope of their audit, however their report does include commentary on the [governance contract.](https://omniscia.io/beanstalk-core-protocol/code-style/GovernanceFacet-GFT) 

Either way, it is surprising that such a vulnerability was not noticed at some point, given that flash loans are [not a novel threat](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/82721/makerdao-issues-warning-after-a-flash-loan-is-used-to-pass-a-governance-vote) to DeFi governance. A delay on execution of on-chain governance proposals is one way to prevent this.

This incident might encourage bagholders to monitor governance proposals more carefully. 

However, the average user may expect such [heavily](https://twitter.com/phtevenstrong/status/1515682798031548417)-[shilled](https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1515693260546920452?s=20&t=hvmqaVrw6bEMLuOIufPXrQ) projects such as Beanstalk to be under vigilance of more experienced eyes.

_DYOR._
