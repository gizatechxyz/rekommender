_Deja-vu, anyone?_

  

**Market maker [Kronos Research](https://kronosresearch.com/) lost $26M over the weekend, leading to liquidity issues on closely-[associated](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jack-tan) CEX, [Woo X](https://woo.org/).**

  

The Taiwan-based trading firm [admitted](https://twitter.com/ResearchKronos/status/1726013733888041376) to having suffered an attack via “_unauthorized access of some of our API keys_”.

  

A later [update](https://twitter.com/ResearchKronos/status/1726203102842466650) confirmed the amount lost, adding “_despite it being a sizable amount, Kronos remains in good standing. All losses will be covered internally, no partners will be affected_”.

  

[According](https://twitter.com/_WOO_X/status/1726016400894898232) to Woo X, Kronos was the exchange’s largest LP, so when their trading was halted following the hack, Woo X decided to pause markets in order to “_protect users positions from a lack of liquidity_”.

**Users were _[not](https://twitter.com/fugcazu/status/1726064152634855911)_ happy.**

A market maker taking heavy losses and disrupting their partner exchange…

_…where have we heard [that](https://rekt.news/ftx-yikes/) before?_

**Kronos Research accounts on four exchanges (across ETH and BSC) began to be drained at approximately [5PM UTC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9d3cac5786d2c1878d1795faea20dd1411da5a800996e15a8d925c109a279c46) on Saturday.**

As well as being transferred directly to the hacker’s address (from OKX and BTSE), funds flowed from CEX wallets, via Kronos’ address and then to the hacker (from Binance and Deeocoin). This was likely due to whitelist restrictions on the addresses to which CEX withdrawals could be made.

Attacker address: **[0x2b0502FDab4e221dcD492c058255D2073d50A3ae](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2b0502FDab4e221dcD492c058255D2073d50A3ae)**

A full breakdown of the assets, exchanges and chains can be seen in the [flowchart](https://twitter.com/x_explore_eth/status/1726583612240503056/photo/1) below:

**This is not the first time Kronos has had issues, as [reported](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1695614615559061557) in August:**

>Two engineers who were dissatisfied with the unpaid bonus tampered with the code of the crypto quantitative trading team Kronos Research before leaving, causing the company to lose $1.4m

**Nor is it the first time API leaks have [led to losses](https://blockworks.co/news/3commas-security-breach) from CEX accounts.**

But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this story is the eerily familiar relationship between Kronos and Woo X.

_Have users [learned nothing](https://twitter.com/tmnxeq/status/1636148035246780417) from last November?_

Previously [boasting](https://twitter.com/dominicVEMP/status/1726026941185081603) of an Alameda/FTX/FTT type setup while half-heartedly [claiming](https://twitter.com/dominicVEMP/status/1726225409363366103) to be credibly separate entities…

With so much in common with the drama that marked the lowest point of the bear market, perhaps we’re coming full circle.

**We all know crypto is cyclical.**

_So this must mean we're back, right?_
