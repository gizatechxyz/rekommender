_A fitting regulator for our circus of an industry._

**Yesterday, the SEC’s official Twitter account announced the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, speculation over which has been dominating price action over past weeks.**

_Markets rejoiced, instantly pumping over $47500._

**However, as this is crypto, the since-deleted announcement had been made by a (_presumably heavily long_) identity thief.**

A few minutes later, SEC Chair Gensler (_presumably not compromised_) [clarified](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744833049064288387):

>The @SECGov twitter account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.

The damage was sudden, with [BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) dumping around 5% in just 15 mins.

The double-whammy and ensuing volatility contributed to over $200M in [liquidations](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData) between shorts and longs, according to CoinGlass data.

**A market-wide pump and dump isn’t the best look for the regulatory body tasked with keeping investors safe.**

**If the SEC can’t even [manage 2FA](https://twitter.com/safety/status/1744924042681897343) on social media accounts, how can can they [expect](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1714020932509982771) to set standards in an industry built around responsibility for personal security?**

>Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.

_Oh, really?_

**The topic of ETF approval has already caused wild swings over recent weeks.**

Crypto holders have suffered a lengthy crypto winter and are banking on the long-awaited confirmation that TradFi is coming to buy our bags, speculating heavily on any hints either way.

Back in October, Cointelegraph ran an [unsourced rumour](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1713949999476711883) that the SEC had approved BlackRock’s iShares ETF, causing over $100M in [liquidations](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/16/bitcoin-momentarily-hits-30k-on-false-spot-etf-approval-report-leads-to-100m-liquidations/) in the ensuing pump-and-dump.

More recently, last week’s [clickbait headline](https://twitter.com/theblockupdates/status/1742521415218176374) from The Block that ETF applications would be rejected in January was the opinion of a single analyst. Matrixport, the analyst’s employer, had even [predicted](https://crypto.news/matrixport-expects-btc-to-surge-to-50k-in-january/) $50k BTC in January the day before, and the firm’s CEO promptly [washed his hands](https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/1742577001633026365) of responsibility for the almost $600M of longs that were wiped out in the accompanying dump.

**It’s fair to say that anticipation was running high, and Gensler’s recent [capitulation thread](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1744383653008839126) made it seem like imminent approval was all but inevitable.**

_So when the expected info came through, many went for the ‘_long first, ask questions later_’ approach._

But [uncharacteristic activity](https://twitter.com/FrankResearcher/status/1744832848639447264) on the SEC’s account gave the game away before the [official correction](https://twitter.com/SECGov/status/1744837121406349714) was published.

**Whether the ETFs are approved today, tomorrow, or down the line, this embarrassing episode has knocked the authority out of the SEC and Gensler’s [tough stance](https://rekt.news/grudgematch-sec/) on crypto.**

If Gary truly wants us to stay safe, he might want to follow his [own advice](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1716786621847392497):

_Even Coinbase is [rubbing salt in the wound](https://www.theblock.co/post/271478/coinbase-executives-offer-to-help-the-sec-with-its-security-practices)._

**While it’s (_very_) easy to laugh at such a [karmic](https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1744848340477493623) self-own, and the SEC itself pumping-and-dumping markets far harder than those they attempt to regulate, there are still people out there who think the crypto community is to [blame](https://twitter.com/functi0nZer0/status/1744857021436825822).**

_But all degens really care about is whether to [buy or sell](https://twitter.com/0xQuit/status/1744834819765494079)._

[US Senators](https://twitter.com/senatorhagerty/status/1744843824654885024), on the other hand, aren't so easy to ignore:

>Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company if they made such a colossal market-moving mistake, Congress needs answers on what just happened. This is unacceptable.

_Will the SEC be forced to investigate itself?_
