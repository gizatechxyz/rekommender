**Tangible’s RWA experiment has got out of hand.**

_And [USDR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/real-usd) is slipping through their fingers…_

The Polygon-based, real-estate-backed stablecoin [began to depeg](https://twitter.com/YouAreMyYield/status/1712075403806859537) on Wednesday after users scrambled to redeem DAI from the token’s reserves.

The remaining collateral was left looking… _[less than tangible](https://twitter.com/YouAreMyYield/status/1712081282081948070)._

While the team claims to have a [plan](https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO/status/1712250414618562725), it seems the market is still sceptical, at least when it comes to pricing USDR:

>USDR is currently 84% collateralized if we mark $TNGBL and the insurance fund to zero.

**But the token is trading at just $0.52.**

Earlier this year, ‘Real Yield’ and ‘RWA’ were the buzzwords which promised to kick off a new cycle, bringing TradFi dollars on-chain, after the money printing [spree](https://rekt.news/gamestonk/) came to an end.

Then, during Silicon Valley Bank’s [meltdown](https://rekt.news/meltdown/) back in March, we got a glimpse of the chaos in TradFi, mirroring the volatility of our own sector.

But to a crypto community in crisis, and with the memory of a goldfish, outsized yields on a supposedly ‘stable’ coin are always tempting.

**A stablecoin promising well above-market yields, backed (in part) by endogenous collateral, suddenly depegging due to a run on backing assets…**

_Where have we heard that [before](https://rekt.news/luna-rekt/)?_

_With interest rates through the roof and global instability on the rise, real-estate markets are no longer looking ‘safe as houses’._

While Tangible’s off-chain assets also include wines, gold bars, and watches, the main focus is a [portfolio](https://www.tangible.store/explore?category=Real%20Estate) of UK properties, which supposedly paid out juicy yields based on rental income.

But given that real estate is not exactly the most liquid of assets, it is surprising that the [USDR reserves](https://www.tangible.store/realusd?action=Stats) value that portion of collateral (currently ~78%) at full price.

In addition to the off-chain assets, USDR’s backing includes DAI (_now fully depleted_), the project’s own TNGBL tokens (_LUNA, anyone?_), protocol-owned liquidity (_including USDR LP tokens_) and an insurance fund (_made up of even more USDR, TNGBL, and locked tokens_).

_Stablecoin-rating agency [Bluechip](https://bluechip.org/#ratings) provides a [detailed breakdown](https://twitter.com/bluechip_org/status/1712392654166589516) of the problems with each of these._

_Given the above, it’s not surprising that users panicked at the first signs of trouble._

A [full risk report](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/risk-assessment-tangible-usdr) from LlamaRisk published in April was met with [pushback](https://medium.com/tangible/llamarisk-assessment-tangible-response-ff012a2885b5) from Tangible team on many of the issues highlighted.

**Then, over the intervening months came multiple [warnings](https://twitter.com/0scaronchain/status/1680912136237731842) over the [situation](https://twitter.com/valentinmihov/status/1697517747956031687), as well as [doubts](https://twitter.com/YouAreMyYield/status/1701919411047628948) about whether the ‘Real Yield’ was, in fact, really real.**

But Tangible clearly [knew](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/how-it-works/redeeming-real-usd) a run like this was possible, and have published a [recovery plan](https://twitter.com/tangibleDAO/status/1712250414618562725), aiming to eventually make users whole via selling down real estate.

According to infamous RFVoor/value investor [0xWismerhill](https://twitter.com/0xWismerhill/status/1712381802067697791), each USDR should be redeemable for:

>$0.052 of stables
>
>$0.78 of face-value RE asset (in the form of baskets = REIT)
>
>$0.168 of locked TNGBL (that receive yield from rents)

But the plan came too late for one user who, presumably worried about a UST-style death spiral, panic-sold and made their worst nightmares [come true](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x329d4a345cc154912be988f91fa03991740f3e866aadba23dc74f484b9e9d438); 131,350 USDR sold for less than a penny.

It remains to be seen whether the plan will lead to a recovery, but in the meantime, anyone hoping to arb a gold bar or luxury watch from the Tangible store will be disappointed to learn that the [ToS](https://www.tangible.store/tos.pdf) state:

>Purchases of TNFT are subject to the availability of the respective Asset. Tangible does not guarantee that any particular TNFT will be available.

**Tangible’s idea of putting real estate on the blockchain is the kind of aspirational use-case that seemed like a logical next step during the highs of crypto’s 2021 bull market.**

But as the last 18 months have shown, just because you can, doesn’t mean you should (especially when considering [who runs](https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1712166449026932907) the verification system).

It’s easy to see the merits of any buzzword-laden idea when easy money makes a success of every innovation.

_But now, with trust at an all time low, anyone left in the market is jumpy, quick to run for the exit at any sign of danger._

**A protocol won’t weather the storm if it isn’t built on sturdy foundations.**
