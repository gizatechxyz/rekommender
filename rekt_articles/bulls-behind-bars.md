excerpt: SBF is on trial and Su Zhu has been arrested in Singapore. Couple more arrests then up only? Washing out the apex-grifters presents an opportunity to return to crypto’s original ethos. Will we use it?

**Familiar faces flooding the feed once again.**

Only this time it’s good news…

_…for us, at least._

**With the trial of SBF kicking off and Su Zhu recently arrested, it’s starting to feel like those who caused so much damage in last year’s collapses are finally facing the music.**

[LUNA](https://rekt.news/luna-rekt/)’s Kwon and ‘[highly profitable](https://rekt.news/mango-markets-rekt/)’ trader [Eisenberg](https://rekt.news/avi-arrested/) have both been locked up for some time, and [Celsius](https://rekt.news/celsius-rekt/)’ Mashkinsky looks [set to join them](https://twitter.com/theblockupdates/status/1709256895339409892) soon.

As last cycle’s bulls are paraded in front of the courts, cameras, and former customers, will this circus only further alienate the public, who look on in bemused embarrassment at what they have always seen as the natural end to the crypto bubble?

_Probably._

**But washing out the apex-grifters also presents an opportunity to return to crypto’s original ethos.**

_Couple more arrests then up only?_

**The Zhupercycle finally came to an end on Friday when 3AC’s co-founder was [arrested](https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1707759144554418558) attempting to leave Singapore.**

The four month sentence is a result of being uncooperative with liquidators in the wake of his fund’s [collapse](https://rekt.news/three-arrows/). Now they know where to find him, at least. Whether he’ll cooperate or not is another question…

A similar committal order has been issued for Zhu’s partner in crime, Kyle Davies, though “_his whereabouts remain unknown_”.

_Probably still [hiding out](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1592880370344919042) in a country with no extradition…_

**News of Zhu's arrest came just days before the start of SBF's trial.**

The former [would-be Regulator](https://rekt.news/sbf-regulator/) and [self-confessed hypocrite](https://rekt.news/sbf-mask-off/) faces charges of defrauding creditors of billions of dollars via the [collapsed](https://rekt.news/ftx-yikes/) FTX exchange, with further charges [coming](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-prosecutors-drop-new-charges-against-bankman-fried-oct-trial-2023-06-15/) next year.

**While it may be satisfying to see Sam hauled in front of a judge, [mainstream](https://www.cbs.com/shows/video/SLLumNQElCg4KvRF7GUbpKX8_VAJaL72/) coverage of the case is still frustratingly sympathetic.**

A constant stream of stories [infantilising](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/inside-sam-bankman-frieds-family-bubble) the 31-year-old, fawning over a figure they present as an [overgrown boy](https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-is-not-a-child) who got in too deep while trying to be as altruistic as possible.

All while making out FTX was a [profitable](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1708665834250391927) business and [conflating](https://twitter.com/CampbellJAustin/status/1708680976597995834) a calculated fraud, using depositors money to gamble on shitcoins, to a bank run caused by messy accounting.

_But we wouldn’t want the truth to get in the way of a good story, would we?_

**Exchanges [aren’t](https://twitter.com/CasPiancey/status/1708636599343632737) banks; they must hold all customer deposits 1:1 at all times (_plus a little extra for when [Lazarus](https://rekt.news/big-phish/) comes [knocking](https://rekt.news/?tag=CEX)…_).**

But SBF has always been his own worst enemy who liked to feel he’s the [smartest](https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1583672040439296000) in the room and that the rules [don’t apply](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbf-could-conceivably-get-bail-revoked-says-judge) to him, even when it’s clear [he isn’t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytaa_5liwMA), and [they do](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/11/sam-bankman-fried-bail-revoked-jail-ftx).

As the trial gets underway, things aren’t looking good for SBF, many of his [closest friends](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/02/sam-bankman-frieds-closest-friends-will-testify-against-him-heres-who-else-well-hear-from/) will be testifying against him, and he even [turned up late](https://protos.com/sbf-arrived-30-minutes-late-for-the-first-day-of-the-rest-of-his-life/) for his first day.

**It looks like he’s having [trouble](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/03/sam-bankman-fried-sues-his-insurer-as-legal-bills-mount/) stumping up the cash to defend himself, too.**

_Has he been forced to [dip into](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1708016654234657233) his rainy-day fund [recently](https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1709548777198215346)?_

Other caged crypto criminals have also been making the news recently…

Do Kwon’s leaked Slack chats include what would be a hilarious degree of [self-incrimination](https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1707816183108391186) if it weren’t for the damage his scam wrought on the sector.

The crypto version of Hanlon's razor:

>Never attribute to incompetence what can adequately be described by crime

Kwon is currently jailed in Montenegro for passport forgery where he faces pressure from the SEC to be deposed, with extradition negotiations to either the US or South Korea ongoing.

Earlier this summer, [Multichain](https://rekt.news/multichain-rekt2/)’s >$100M demise was also allegedly due to the [arrest](https://rekt.news/multichain-r3kt/) of CEO Zhaojun who turned out to be holding all the keys to the supposedly decentralised bridge.

And more recently, at least 18 arrests in connection with Hong Kong exchange JPEX which [may have rugged](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1704743290908950874) after authorities [warned](https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1701901847156711892) of possible criminal charges against the platform.

**With so many of last cycle’s main characters behind bars, who’s even left?**

3AC’s Kyle Davies is still on the run, quiet since his buddy’s arrest.

Sam Trabucco, Alameda’s former CEO, decided to [set sail](https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1562519118741323778) into the sunset before everything went down in flames, but looks like he’ll be making an [appearance](https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1709287042016747603) at his SBF’s trial.

_How many more will the bear claim before retreating into hibernation, making way for a new set of bulls, each gunning for the limelight, and possibly a future jail cell?_

While we all welcome the villains of last cycle facing the consequences of their actions, normies will equate these scammers and fraudsters with crypto as a whole, without making the distinction between custodial platforms and DeFi.

But as we all know, the majority of these crimes are down to the centralisation of power, and placing trust in snake oil salesmen. These cases [couldn't have happened](https://twitter.com/lemiscate/status/1707764673611764175) in DeFi.

The fallout may have stained public perception for now, but the only way to change the opinions of society at large is via demonstration of a reliable alternative.

**With ongoing macro problems, trust in TradFi is at an all-time low, DeFi has an opportunity to show that we can do it better.**

Despite the regulatory [shock and awe](https://rekt.news/grudgematch-sec/) being waged on crypto at large, we have an [advantage](https://twitter.com/BackTheBunny/status/1688724420893040640).

_Will we use it?_
