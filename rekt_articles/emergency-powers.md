_Democracy dies not with a bang, but with an [emergency proposal](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-risk-parameter-changes-february-18-2025)._

  

**Sky, previously known as MakerDAO, DeFi's governance grandfather, just became a battleground between reform and resistance.**

  

Some call it a protocol coup, others a defensive necessity.

  

Either way, a midnight vote doubled borrowing limits, critics found themselves silenced, and power concentrated faster than you can say "decentralization."

  

_The official story? Protecting against shadowy governance attacks._

  

**Maybe a power grab, maybe protocol defense - depends which side of the ban hammer you're standing on.**

  

[Collateral requirements dropped](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-risk-parameter-changes-february-18-2025) from 200% to 125%, lending limits doubled overnight, and the usual month-long governance theatre condensed into a few dark hours.

  

These weren't just number changes - they were a fundamental redrawing of risk boundaries, justified by an allegedly imminent threat.

  

As supporters tell it, only these extreme measures could counter a sophisticated governance assault.

  

Lower collateral means higher leverage, higher leverage means bigger liquidation cascades, and bigger cascades mean more opportunities for someone to break the protocol.

  

Some call it protection. Others see a protocol eating itself alive.

  

**Between banned critics and backroom deals, MakerDAO's emergency measures look suspiciously like the centralized control they were meant to prevent.**

  

_When guardians of decentralization start acting like dictators, who guards the guardians?_

**MakerDAO wrote the book on DeFi governance. Now they're burning the pages.**

  

Between the lines of emergency proposals and hasty votes lies a story of power, paranoia, and protocol politics.

  

The official narrative spins tales of governance attacks and noble defenders. The evidence tells a different story.

  

[GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX), a vocal advocate for reform, had [spent weeks following proper channels](https://x.com/ImperiumPaper/status/1892157951101542817).

  

_[Their proposals](https://x.com/ImperiumPaper/status/1892157951101542817) read like a governance wishlist: demanding transparency for an $80M budget plus 15,000 MKR allocation, pushing for fair treatment of DAI holders in savings rates, calling for an end to forced contributor anonymity._

  

**They [sought to redirect marketing funds](https://x.com/ImperiumPaper/status/1892157952850620500) toward growing markets and secure a 25% SPK allocation for MKR holders.**

  

These weren't random demands - they came after a year of disappointing performance, a failed rebrand, and growing community frustration.

  

All proposals followed proper submission processes.

  

All included the standard one-month review period. None posed any apparent threat to protocol security.

  

Their reward for playing by the rules?

  

Banned accounts and silenced voices as an "emergency" proposal rushed through the night.

  

**A month of review for transparency proposals. Zero hours for emergency powers. No debate, no discussion, no dissent allowed.**

  

_When reform proposals need a month of review but emergency powers only need a midnight vote, is it really the reformers we should fear?_  
  
### Midnight Maneuvers

  

_Governance theater needs a dramatic final act. This one might be tragedy or triumph - the reviews aren't in yet._

  

**In DeFi's familiar pattern, emergency measures have a curious tendency to become permanent features.**

  

Yesterday's crisis response becomes tomorrow's standard operating procedure. This case proved no different.

  

While critics slept, power brokers allegedly rammed through their "emergency" proposal faster than you can say decentralization. No debate needed when you've got bans ready.

  

[The script called for](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-risk-parameter-changes-february-18-2025) doubling USDS borrowing against MKR while dropping collateral requirements off a cliff - from 200% to 125%.

  

_Throw in [removed exit fees](https://forum.sky.money/t/simplifying-seal-engine-and-activation-removing-exit-fee/26023) and you've got yourself a midnight special that would make any TradFi banker blush._

  

**But the drama didn't end with the vote. Days later, Rune pushed through another proposal - dramatically [reducing the Surplus Buffer](https://forum.sky.money/t/smart-burn-engine-parameter-update-feb-21-spell/26033) from 120M to 70M and activating a Smart Burn Engine.**

  

The result? [Sky began aggressively buying and burning](https://x.com/RuneKek/status/1894126606085697601) its own token at nearly 1M USDS per day.

  

What some call a [defensive necessity](https://x.com/threesigmaxyz/status/1892169789822455865), others see as [governance by guillotine](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892253800796422518).

  

Anyone questioning this democracy speedrun found their Discord and governance forum [access revoked faster than a rug pull](https://x.com/traders_insight/status/1892270766307017060).

  

Forum privileges? Gone. Voice in the community? Silenced.

  

**The official story claims shadowy governance attackers lurked in the dark.**

  

_But with moves like these, who's really casting the shadows?_

  

### The Alleged Official Story

  

_Between failed rebrands and financial repression of DAI, tensions had been building._

  

**Rune and his defenders [paint a picture of noble resistance](https://x.com/RuneKek/status/1891984687288963140) against hostile takeover.**

  

Critics see a founder desperately clinging to control.

  

Was this a hostile takeover attempt or just aggressive activist investing?

  

[The alleged plot](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892253800796422518) involved Imperium Paper partnering with Nexo - the "extremely sketchy exchange" - supposedly planning to manipulate oracles, liquidate positions, and seize control.

  

_But what one side calls an "attack," the other calls "shareholder activism."_

  

**[The leaked screenshots](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892253800796422518) could be a smoking gun - or just smoke.**

  

Supporters saw evidence of a [coordinated attack](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892372632336511468). Critics saw standard [activist investor strategy](https://x.com/ivangbi_/status/1892289179981423046?s=).

  

The line between defense and preemptive strike blurred in the rush to consolidate power.

  

Traders familiar with the situation [suggest a more nuanced reality](https://x.com/traders_insight/status/1892368571331748120): "Both Rune and Paper want the best for Maker - they just have different opinions on policy and implementation."

  

_As Paper built his [opposition coalition](https://x.com/traders_insight/status/1892368571331748120) through proper channels, leaked screenshots - potentially taken out of context - triggered the emergency powers._

  

**Hexonaut, defender of the midnight vote, [warned of treasury looting and price manipulation](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892253800796422518).**

  

But the ['evidence' so far](https://x.com/hexonaut/status/1892253800796422518)? Screenshots of strategy discussions - potentially alarming, but [not a smoking gun](https://x.com/mihai673/status/1892279749679980764).  
  
Still, fear moves faster than facts. Whether the threat was real or just rhetoric, the response was swift - and extreme.

  

_The emergency response may have been more calculated than reactive._

  

**By [jacking up LTVs for MKR borrowers](https://x.com/traders_insight/status/1892368571331748120) (primarily Rune), the changes allowed shifting loans from external platforms like Aave and Morpho directly to Maker.**

  

But here's the crucial difference: unlike external platforms, MKR borrowed within Maker [retains its governance rights](https://x.com/threesigmaxyz/status/1895086785035714586).

  

By shifting debt into Maker, Rune didn't just protect his loans - he [ensured borrowed MKR kept its voting power](https://x.com/threesigmaxyz/status/1895086785035714586). Governance defense or just a well-timed self-preservation move?

  

**More borrowing, less collateral, faster debt ceiling increases. Protection through vulnerability - truly galaxy brain stuff.**

  

_When your emergency powers make emergencies more likely, maybe the real emergency was the governance we made along the way?_

  

### Governance is Theater

  

_MakerDAO's midnight drama might just be Act One in crypto's oldest play: activist investors versus entrenched power, this time wearing Web3 masks._

  

**As [Kazuya puts it](https://x.com/Kazuya_888/status/1892174712957964704), after following countless DAO politics, these protocols are less about decentralization and more about cartel behavior - with governance tokens serving as expensive tickets to a show where all the important decisions happen backstage.**

  

The script plays out in backroom Discord channels and dinner meetings.

  

Whales accumulate power. The community raises concerns. Opposition forms. Emergency powers activate.

  

Whether you call it protection or power grab depends on which side of the ban hammer you're standing.

  

_MakerDAO was supposed to be different - the boring, process-driven grandfather of DeFi governance._

  

**Now it's caught between activist investors and entrenched power, with both sides claiming to protect the protocol.**

  

The emergency vote was just Act One. Days later, Rune [pushed another proposal](https://forum.sky.money/t/smart-burn-engine-parameter-update-feb-21-spell/26033) - dramatically reducing the Surplus Buffer from 120M to 70M and activating a Smart Burn Engine.

  

Hostile takeovers just got a whole lot more expensive, with SKY tokens [being burned at nearly 1M USDS per day](https://x.com/RuneKek/status/1894126606085697601).

  

What happened after the vote confirms what DeFi veterans already know: governance wars have no clean endings.

  

Perhaps the real story isn't about villains and heroes - it's about what happens when traditional corporate raiders meet DeFi's promise of decentralization.

  

_Turns out both sides know how to play governance games._

  

**Want to participate in governance? Better hire a full-time babysitter to watch your token's voting power.**

  

Miss one midnight emergency proposal and you might wake up to find the entire protocol rewritten while you slept.

  

Some say the most honest approach is forgetting governance theater entirely.

  

**Bet on a centralized team with vested tokens and at least when they rug you, they're rugging their own bags too.**

  

_If DAOs are just centralization with extra steps, why are we still pretending to dance?_

_Democracy died in a Discord channel at midnight. No shots fired, just a governance proposal and a ban hammer._

  

**DeFi's decentralized dream choked on emergency powers and backroom deals.**

  



  

The MakerDAO saga reveals the uncomfortable truth about governance tokens - they're not voting rights, they're backstage passes to a show where whales write the script and ban hammers are the ultimate critic's review.

  

_MakerDAO just did a speedrun on governance drama, but don't expect this to be the last midnight power shift in DeFi._

  

**The DAO dream isn't dead - it just keeps waking up to find its rules rewritten overnight.**

  

Behind every decentralized protocol lurks a panic button, and we're all just hoping it's pressed in our favor.

  

Governance tokens were supposed to be a vote. Turns out, they’re just an expensive ticket to a show where the script gets rewritten at midnight.

  

**Next time someone celebrates decentralized governance, ask them where they were when MakerDAO turned democracy into dinner theater.**

  

_Is DeFi governance about decentralization, or just another form of corporate power struggle?_
