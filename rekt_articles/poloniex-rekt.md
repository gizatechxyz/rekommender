_Nothing like a nine-figure exchange hack to cool the pump-induced euphoria._

**Justin Sun’s exchange [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/) had its hot wallets drained of $126M today.**

The [alarm](https://twitter.com/CyversAlerts/status/1722931014832370130) was [raised](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1722931275764474329). Then, approximately half an hour after funds [began](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcbf1547119ae869604585997b11d118bb423f32ae75c2fe055b7eb8d79d3ae77) to be drained, Poloniex [notified](https://twitter.com/PoloSupport/status/1722934043543752968) users its wallet had been “_disabled for maintenance_”.

_Nothing to see here, folks._

**After another half hour, Justin Sun responded more [directly](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1722942733680296246), promising to cover losses:**

>We are currently investigating the Poloniex hack incident. Poloniex maintains a healthy financial position and will fully reimburse the affected funds. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities for collaboration with other exchanges to facilitate the recovery of these funds.

As the amounts stacked up, Poloniex [followed up](https://twitter.com/Poloniex/status/1722956238160536049) with a whitehat bounty offer of 5%. Arkham’s on-chain intel market (or [doxx-to-earn](https://rekt.news/arkham-asylum/) platform) also [offered](https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1722944982456078544) a $4000 bounty for an ID on the hacker.

_Will it be enough to either tempt, or force, a return of the loot this time?_

**As ever, exchange hacks are often down to off-chain attack vectors, with the aim of gaining access to a device or an employee in order to extract private keys.**

Organised threat actors, such as North Korea’s Lazarus Group, are [well-versed](https://rekt.news/big-phish/) in a [variety of methods](https://rekt.news/big-phish/) to carry out extensive phishing [campaigns](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1703603575954583985). So far this year, over $250M has been lost in incidents linked to the group, including attacks on [Atomic Wallet](https://rekt.news/atomic-wallet-rekt/), [AlphaPo](https://rekt.news/alphapo-rekt/), [Stake](https://rekt.news/stake-rekt/) and [CoinEx](https://rekt.news/coinex-rekt/).

_Could this be another big payday for the DPRK?_

**Regardless of who was responsible, for Poloniex the attack began at 10:30 AM UTC, with a [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcbf1547119ae869604585997b11d118bb423f32ae75c2fe055b7eb8d79d3ae77) draining 4900 ETH ($10M) from the address labelled [Poloniex 4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa910f92acdaf488fa6ef02174fb86208ad7722ba) on Etherscan.**

The attack continued on Ethereum, TRON and BTC, with a total of $126M lost, according to Arkham’s [attacker profile](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/893f9614-ccae-4b56-bf6e-6b072b297b5c) (which displays totals of $59.2M, $48.6M, $18.6M held on the three chains, respectively).

Main attacker address (ETH): **[0x0a5984f86200415894821bfefc1c1de036dbf9e7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0a5984f86200415894821bfefc1c1de036dbf9e7)**

Main attaker address (TRON): **[TKK6d1YALy8HCSoCSWWd1ZJhyC9NPPx4wa](https://tronscan.org/#/address/TKK6d1YALy8HCSoCSWWd1ZJhyC9NPPx4wa)**

Main attaker address (BTC): **[bc1qnpc7u2ha7ct9c458rrqsawylz9e9j6jvkvzttt](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qnpc7u2ha7ct9c458rrqsawylz9e9j6jvkvzttt)**

Dispersal of tokens among many hacker addresses on Ethereum (labelled [2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5c2aeb0bc2f6597470698b3b31f606c74c5ec551), [3](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93f6344465e398de70c145c470bc28d46756ec4a), [4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ce8c5ad1339fb9d7e40f0f4e234e7ca847163de), [5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6fdc04a1f47376b3b202ba1af90a5f78f544f18e), [6](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4be46ebbe246acb1faca6adee665279c5bf69d4b), [7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x97beb3b19c674f4a70193b69c5115d8ecc7cc9ec), [8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e4a696068895a9f5dd93bb1edee985d6f6a0496), [9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9e3b8da544bbacb7a7f5284dc9c2aff111180efd), [11](https://etherscan.io/address/0xefcf293e7710fec293f6cede50de6db0953ee17f), [12](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fcb19ea65effc08dddd01d1b804a2924d266ac0), [13](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24d344a09479f8093e907ab9a6d22202cdacfef3), [14](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd262b0ee6110e86088a627a492f9e67a721b29fd), [15](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4df469dead6ea63ab81c795493c56642ce4ba100)) which were used to swap out tokens to ETH and hold it, or further it disperse to new addresses.

The largest asset losses were of 33M USDT (22M on TRON and 11M on ETH), 4900 ETH ($10M) on Ethereum, $18.6M of native BTC and a further $14M of BTC on TRON and $5M USDC on Ethereum.

_SlowMist compiled a lengthy (though not yet complete) [breakdown](https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1722965423803580735) of assets stolen._

**The hacker’s actions on-chain had some unexpected results.**

In swapping out (freezable) the USDT stolen on Tron to TRX, the attacker [pumped](https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1722937259530264704) Justin Sun’s bags by 25%. At least it makes up for some of the losses he’s promised to cover…

**And in the rush to liquidate stolen assets, the attacker lost almost $2.6M worth of Golem Network’s GLM by [transferring it](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc9700e4f072878c4e4066d1c9cd160692468f2d1c4c47795d28635772abc18db) directly to the token’s contract.**

_Whoops._

**In late-September HTX (formerly Huobi) was [hit for $7.9M](https://rekt.news/htx-huobi-rekt/), with Sun [making it clear](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706313152231575695) that reimbursing users would be small change for someone with pockets as deep as His Excellency’s.**

Luckily for Justin, he ultimately managed to escape shelling out for a costly compensation scheme when the funds were [returned](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1710687727686160676) less than two weeks later.

**Now, he has promised to cover losses over 10x larger…**

_…while offering a (lower-than-the-going-rate) 5% bounty and a 7-day grace period to think it over._

Is he confident the hacker will take him up on it? Or feeling over-confident after getting lucky last time?

_How deep do Sun’s pockets go?_
