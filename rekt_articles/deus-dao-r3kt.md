_It’s a hat trick for [Deus DAO](https://twitter.com/DeusDao)._

**Token holders lost a total of ~$6.5M on Arbitrum, BSC and Etherum, and the [DEI stablecoin](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dei-token) depegged over 80%.**

This incident, just over a year since their [last appearance](https://rekt.news/deus-dao-rekt-2/), makes Deus DAO the third protocol with three entries on our [leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/).

Deus’ two previous entries were on the project’s original home, FTM, where they don’t appear to have been affected. Since then, DEI has branched out onto other chains.

After the [alarm was raised](https://twitter.com/hippo_potato/status/1654555505854152704), and the [root cause identified](https://twitter.com/adamb83024264/status/1654558408803250176), Deus eventually [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/DeusDao/status/1654614967084101633) the hack, as well as confirming a multisig address for whitehats to return funds.

_But how many times can a thrice-hacked protocol be trusted?_

A simple implementation error was introduced into the DEI token contract, in an upgrade last month. The burnFrom function was misconfigured, with the ‘_allowances’ parameters ‘msgSender’ and ‘account’ written into the contract in the wrong order.

This created a public (or pubic, according to [Peckshield](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1654626667787321344)) burn vulnerability, which an attacker is then able to manipulate and gain control of DEI holders’ approvals and transfer assets directly to their own address.

The mis-ordered parameters allow the attacker to set a large token approval for any DEI holder’s address. Then, by burning 0 tokens from the address, the approval is updated to the attacker’s address, who can drain the holder’s funds.

See the [following](https://twitter.com/PaladinCharles/status/1654585109964619777) step-by-step:

>identify an address with a huge amount of DEI
>
>approve to this address
>
>call burnFrom with amount = 0 and this address
>
>During the burnFrom it grants approves all tokens from the address to your own
>
>call transferFrom

Attacker’s address (Arbitrum): **[0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1)**

Attacker’s address (Ethereum): [0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x189cf534de3097c08b6beaf6eb2b9179dab122d1)

**According to BlockSec’s [MetaSleuth](https://twitter.com/MetaSleuth/status/1654688526095745024), the losses were approximately $5M on Arbitrum, $1.3M on BSC and $135k on Ethereum.**

Luckily, the exploit on BSC was frontrun, and an on-chain [message](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x6cda17b36013ab3d5c2ed95cdb56256bffcb4f086f0c849ae53d4f036f96c322) to the Deus Deployer shows the intent to return the funds. Other [whitehats](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1654576766927634432) also sprang into action, and over $600k in USDC has so far been returned to a [recovery multisig](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf8b5e2e99faea5a3416822123c8eca24309cab99#tokentxns).

_However, there were also [doubts](https://twitter.com/adamb83024264/status/1654577806628761600) about the usefulness of giving funds back to a team that produced such a trivial bug._

**Returning rescued funds to a thrice-hacked protocol seems rather counterproductive…**

An official update mentions a [recovery plan](https://twitter.com/DeusDao/status/1654808611263246336) for users who lost out in the exploit, and Deus have [reached out](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa99e7ee2889fddd52f2c1549072f290516e1001b3220e44f0e62d9ec26341abe) to the attacker on-chain.

But given the account was originally [funded](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8b1fd7b6726499fcd4bf4d593fe7be80c2ec134d81db1d431cb590a9ea88147a) via Tornado Cash on BSC, it’s not looking good.

_Will this be finally be a killing blow for Deus DAO?_
