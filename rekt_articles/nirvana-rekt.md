**Nirvana Finance lost $3.5M yesterday to a flash loan attack.**

_Is this “[DeFi 3.0](https://twitter.com/nirvana_fi)”?_

The recently-launched, Solana-based protocol claims that it “_transforms risk into reward_” whilst boasting a “_known maximum downside and unlimited upside._”

_Who knew that the maximum downside could be almost -90%..._

The team eventually [announced](https://twitter.com/nirvana_fi/status/1552629332023152641) the loss, hours after the news had been [broken](https://twitter.com/0xFA2/status/1552576598506762240) by the SolanaFM team. However, a post mortem is yet to be published.

As in the case of [Crema Finance](https://rekt.news/crema-finance-rekt/), the exploiter made use of flash loans from [Solend](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1552596718864465920), the lending protocol which found itself in a [governance crisis](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1538619072438411264) last month.

**The Nirvana team has made an [appeal](https://twitter.com/nirvana_fi/status/1552761630127177730) to the hacker to return the funds.**

_But will the hacker choose the path of enlightenment?_

The attacker took a $10M flash loan from Solend, which was then used to mint ANA, inflating the price of ANA from ~$8 to ~$24.

The overpriced ANA was then used to cashed out USDT via Nirvana’s treasury, netting the exploiter ~$3.5M in profit, on top of the flash loaned amount.

The stolen funds were then bridged via Wormhole to the attacker’s [ETH address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9ae2624ab08661f010185d72dd506e199e67c09), where they remain at the time of writing.

Following last year’s SBF-pumped success of [Solana summer](https://rekt.news/spotlight-on-solana/), ever since the [Wormhole hack](https://rekt.news/wormhole-rekt/), it seems that Solana’s relevance has been waning.

**As VCs move on to the [latest retail-bait L1](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/25/aptos-labs-raises-150m-to-revive-diem-in-ftx-ventures-led-funding-round/) promising fast transactions and endless scalability, will projects like these prove to be the last cash-grabs of an ecosystem past its prime?**

Nirvana’s [docs](https://docs.nirvana.finance/mechanics/summary) read like a glossary of DeFi buzzwords and statements like “_ANA protects its holders against catastrophic stablecoin depegging_” and “_The ANA token cannot go to zero_”

**The charts beg to differ.**

“Superstable” [NIRV](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nirvana-nirv):

“Reserve-backed” [ANA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nirvana-ana):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/07/nirvana-ana.png)

From the hyperbole to the “[automatic audit](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62acc2bbfa68c06f0b46f628/62c729b1b482b308072715b2_nirvana-audit-certificate.pdf)” completed earlier this month, this protocol doesn’t seem built to last…

A user on Solana Forums may have put it best with the following [comment](https://forums.solana.com/t/what-does-nirvana-do/7434):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/07/nirvana-forum.png)

The team seem to have [made peace](https://twitter.com/nirvana_fi/status/1552668321962762242) with the fate of their tokens, only time will tell if they’ll get a chance at reincarnation.

Oh well...

_Nevermind._
