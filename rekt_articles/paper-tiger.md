_Not all tigers earn their stripes. Some just paint them on._

  

**[Parallel Finance](https://x.com/ParallelFi) emerged from Silicon Valley's dream factory with all the right stamps of approval - Stanford dropout founder - [Yubo Ruan](https://www.yuboruan.com/), [Sequoia's millions](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/08/sequoia-jumps-into-token-plays-with-investment-in-defi-project-parallel/), and enough buzzwords to fill a VC pitch deck.**

  

Behind the polished PR and carefully [curated Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yubo_Ruan) lurked a project that promised revolution but delivered regression.

  

A chain abandoned, assets mismanaged, and a community left searching for answers.

  

Millions in user funds now hang in the balance while governance theater plays out its final act.

  

**The governance keys to the kingdom have been seized, and those carefully painted stripes are washing away in the rain.**

  
_When VCs sell you a tiger, maybe check its teeth first?_

  **The crypto world loves its origin stories, and Parallel's reads like a bestseller.**

  

With an [early parachain slot](https://parachains.info/details/parallel_finance) on Polkadot's crown jewels, a billion-dollar vision, and enough audits to wallpaper an office.

  

They [stacked security audits like trophies](https://docs.parallel.fi/parallel-finance-polkadot-app/security) - Trail of Bits, Halborn, SlowMist - letting the big names speak louder than their findings.

  

_The [press releases poured](https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/parallel-finance-founder-yubo-ruan-on-revolutionizing-defi-with-omni-chain-solution/) like wine - "Revolutionary DeFi capabilities" and "Omni-chain future" each promise more intoxicating than the last._

  

Between glowing features and a suspiciously detailed Wikipedia page for the founder, the hype grew bigger than the protocol.

  

Parallel wasn't just selling DeFi dreams - they were printing headlines faster than they were shipping code.

  

**But in crypto's theater of dreams, even the best-funded actors can forget their lines.**

  

_When your press releases outnumber your products, who's really buying the story you're selling?_

  
### Painted Stripes  
  

_The first cracks appeared when action replaced promises._

  

**Their revolutionary DeFi services? Basic liquid staking and crowdloans - the blockchain equivalent of a microwave dinner claiming to be haute cuisine.**

  

But bland offerings were just the appetizer.

  

The [team obfuscated their moves](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326) through batch calls - - bundling multiple transactions into a single opaque execution that made tracing individual actions nearly impossible, akin to writing a check in invisible ink.

  

This level of complexity wasn’t just bad documentation—it was deliberate misdirection, keeping both users and auditors in the dark.

  

_[Behind the curtain](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326), they minted cDOT tokens in secret, burned user positions without warning, and manipulated collateral ratios at will._
  
**This secretive minting not only diluted user holdings but also eroded trust, creating systemic risk as Parallel operated more like a centralized entity than the decentralized protocol it claimed to be.**

  

Their hunger grew beyond their own chain. In an attempted sleight of hand, they [tried minting 140,000 xcGLMR out of thin air](https://x.com/0xTaylor_/status/1846973298703585566) on Moonbeam's network.  
  
This exploit threatened Moonbeam's XCM security and forced emergency actions—akin to patching a hole while the ship is sinking - to prevent a cascade of vulnerabilities across Polkadot’s ecosystem.

  

Emergency proposals flew as [Moonbeam scrambled to close their XCM channels](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-74-fast-track-proposal-to-secure-159k-glmr-in-response-to-potential-parallel-finance-chain-exploit/1898) - like boarding up windows before a storm.

  

_When questioned, the team's responses grew as thin as their documentation._

  

**The grand finale was a masterclass in disappearance.**

  

Chain abandoned, community ghosted, all while [pivoting to an L2 solution](https://x.com/ParallelFi/status/1765921281084456968) that nobody asked for and fewer used.

  

Their native token $PARA didn't just bleed - it evaporated. One day it was trading, the next "[delisted for rebranding](https://x.com/ParallelFi/status/1765921281084456968)."

  

The [promise of an airdrop](https://x.com/ParallelFi/status/1765921281084456968) hung in the air like smoke from a magician's misdirection.

  

**March 2024's token relaunch promised the greatest trick yet - turning nothing into something.**

  

_When every trick ends in disappearance, is the magician still practicing or just perfecting his exit?_

  
### Burning Paper  
  
_A self-proclaimed white hat [seized control of Parallel's chain](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1322?tab=call) in November 2024, upgrading the runtime to add their own "sudo" pallet - gifting themselves administrative powers through code._

  

**[The prize?](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326) From Parallel's exposed millions, 200,000 DOT hung in the balance - 75,000 already moved to Ethereum, another 125,000 ticking down in the unbonding queue.**

  

The team's final defense? Disabling their own blockchain explorers, as if turning off the lights could hide what lurked in the dark.

  

The community's response proved as hollow as the protocol itself.

  

[Referendum 1322](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1322?tab=call) emerged like smoke and mirrors - a proposal that promised salvation but held no real power.

  

The proposal called for 100 million DOT worth of votes - a mountain of support for what amounted to an empty gesture.

  

Meanwhile, the attacker exposed the team's own history of manipulation - from attempted GLMR minting to suspicious batch calls, the paper tiger's teeth had always been sharp enough to bite.

  

**What emerged wasn't just a predator in prey's clothing - it was a calculated deception months in the making.**

  

_When your attacker sounds more honest than your audits, who's really wearing the black hat?_

  
### Paper Chase  
  

_The self-proclaimed white hat's motives remained as opaque as the batch calls they exposed._

  

**The governance proposal played out like the final act of a shell game - an empty gesture of democracy while assets moved freely in the shadows.**

  

Seven percent of Polkadot's total supply - a mountain of DOT to move a proposal without power.

  

The crypto community watched with a familiar sense of déjà vu.

  

Another protocol burning, another founder silent, another community left holding charred dreams and worthless tokens.

  

**Assets flowed through the shadows, while the governance theater played out on the main stage.**

  

The team had written this script months ago - the attacker just changed the ending.

  

Between the team's suspicious transactions and a chain left to rot on Polkadot's vine, the signs were there. The attacker just lit them up in neon.

  

**In DeFi's jungle, sometimes it takes a predator to expose a paper tiger.**

  

_When everyone's wearing stripes, are the real predators the ones holding the paintbrush?_

_Today on Polkadot's chain, [Parallel Finance’s slot](https://parachains.info/details/parallel_finance) stands as a monument to misplaced trust - a reminder that pedigree doesn't guarantee performance._

  

**Between Stanford credentials and Sequoia's stamp of approval, Parallel had all the markings of crypto royalty. But stripes painted on paper wash away in the rain.**

  

The governance drama plays out its final scene, DOT flowing across chains while the community votes on empty promises.

  

Somewhere in Silicon Valley, another "visionary" founder is practicing their pitch, collecting their VCs, and preparing to sell their own paper tiger to the masses.

  

**The lesson isn't written in venture capital term sheets or suspicious Wikipedia pages - it's hidden in the transactions that promised security but delivered sleight of hand.**

  

_In crypto's endless parade of apex predators, maybe it's time to stop counting stripes and start checking for paper cuts?_
