excerpt: Degens didn’t cross the line—they erased it. The rise of live streaming on pump.fun turned crypto into a grotesque circus of human suffering, where chaos, greed, and depravity spiraled into outright criminality.

_The screen flickers as a teenager adjusts his webcam, the noose already secured to his bedroom ceiling._

  

**His dead-eyed stare meets 200 viewers on pump.fun's livestream while he makes his demand: if his memecoin doesn't hit the $25 million market cap, [they'll watch him hang](https://x.com/0xExorcized/status/1860894406280454545).**

  

This is not a scene from some bizarre dystopian horror movie, this just happened in Web 3.

  

What began as a token creation platform mutated into a digital colosseum where desperate performers compete through increasingly disturbing acts.

  

**From creators firing handguns with each price pump to filming animal cruelty for token attention, pump.fun has become crypto's own cringe factory.**

  

_When did we stop being degens and start becoming monsters?_

**[Since adding livestreams](https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1795592662260793764), pump.fun has morphed from aspiring content creators drawing eggs and chatting with viewers into a showcase of increasingly deranged behavior.**

  

First came "[Crack Head Dev](https://decrypt.co/246047/crack-head-dev-solana-meme-coin)" Trevv, the [19-year-old fentanyl addict](https://x.com/9trevv) who faked his own death during a stream to pump $CHD.

  

Not content with his viral moment, [he returned with $STD](https://x.com/MaransCrypto/status/1859241064567320793), promising to have sex with a stripper live on air, before pivoting to snorting drugs off someone's birthday cake for his latest token.

  

**His antics set off a twisted competition, which [Pump.fun endorsed](https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1827100634765754620) - each new creator trying to outdo the last in a desperate bid for attention.**

  

What began with recreational drug use spiraled into genuine danger.

  

One creator [fired a handgun out their window](https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1860627600097366129) each time their token price surged.

  

**Another launched "Chicken Fight Club" ($CFC), culminating in the [actual killing of a chicken](https://x.com/whoismowgli/status/1860895202531045618) - only to immediately launch a follow-up token $MIKE supposedly seeking "justice" for the same animal they had just slaughtered.**

  

_Is there no depth crypto won't plumb in pursuit of the next pump?_  
  
### Deja Lewd

  

_Back in "[Growing Pains](https://rekt.news/growing-pains/)," we warned about Solana's breakneck development leaving "a trail of wreckage in its wake."_

  

**By "[Meme Mania](https://rekt.news/meme-mania/)," the ecosystem had devolved into "a Lord of the Flies environment where bad actors run rampant."**

  

Our "[Vulture Culture](https://rekt.news/vulture-culture/)" piece warned that "the jackass mind virus is very contagious and apparently getting worse over time."

  

The signs were clear. Each article documented pump.fun's inevitable descent into depravity.

  

The platform didn't just enable degeneracy - it incentivized escalation.

  

_When memes and money mix with zero oversight, humans will always push boundaries until they break._

  

**The platform's descent reads like a speed run through humanity's worst impulses and makes Idiocracy look like it could be a prophecy.**

  

In May, [TruthOrDare's ($DARE) so called developer](https://decrypt.co/231807/solana-dev-hospitalized-burns-pump-meme-coin) landed in Miami's trauma unit with third-degree burns after streaming himself being shot with fireworks while doused in alcohol.

  

Like addicts chasing an ever-elusive high, creators pushed further into darkness.  
  
Are there any limits to what humanity will do for money and attention?

  

**By November, the platform had transformed into a catalogue of horrors - [creators firing guns with each price surge](https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1860627600097366129), the $CFC team's [on-camera animal slaughter](https://x.com/whoismowgli/status/1860895202531045618), and [multiple instances](https://x.com/MirzaKB01/status/1860919175507595501) of self-harm threats broadcast to hundreds of viewers.**

  

_With no terms of service and overwhelmed moderators, pump.fun quickly became Web3's version of the darker corners of the internet._

  

### Digital Russian Roulette

  

_Pump.fun unleashed a new wave of high-stakes psychological manipulation - creators threatening self-harm unless their tokens moon._

  

**The [teenager with the noose](https://x.com/0xExorcized/status/1860894406280454545) wasn't an isolated incident and [may have been staged](https://x.com/Eiimikooo/status/1860900738869920136).**

  

One user held viewers hostage with [claims they'd kill their family](https://x.com/melfoy_work/status/1860338708685209801) if price targets weren't met.

  

Another threatened to [shoot up a school](https://x.com/JoeyMooose/status/1860891432560545913).

  

The animal cruelty took the cringe to another level, whether it was a man [threatening to shoot his dog](https://x.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1860644432984330285) or [another threatening a goldfish](https://x.com/xmaherart/status/1860472242238316729).

  

[Beau Security documented streams](https://x.com/beausecurity/status/1860859118124138610) of users slashing their forearms, playing with fire, and engaging in other forms of self-mutilation - all for token pumps.

  

_As clips spread across crypto Twitter and mainstream media took notice, pump.fun's facade of harmless entertainment crumbled._

  

**Each livestreamed threat and every broadcast of criminal behavior contributes to a [growing body of evidence](https://x.com/crypto__kermit/status/1861349389287244175) that spans across borders.**

  

Acts such as broadcasting self-harm, exploiting minors, and documenting animal cruelty could trigger investigations from law enforcement agencies worldwide.

  

[Founder Alon's defense](https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860036153249787911) - "We have a large team of moderators working around the clock" - rang hollow against mounting evidence of unmoderated mayhem.

  

The public outcry grew deafening and it appears they were heard.

  

_In response to growing outrage, [pump.fun quietly removed livestreams](https://x.com/Tyler_Did_It/status/1861128450402050420), but the damage is already done._

  

**Profit first, morality later - pump.fun's damage control comes after the blood money.**

  

After watching its users livestream self-harm for weeks, [pump.fun finally discovered a moral compass](https://pump.fun/docs/moderation-message) hiding behind their revenue dashboard.

  

Even CZ - the exchange king who listed every dog coin under the sun - now [thinks meme tokens have gone too far](https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1861306581758976434), calling for "real applications" instead of whatever twisted entertainment pump.fun has become.

  
The [platform's metrics mask a darker reality](https://x.com/NewsInSmol/status/1861426796987629730): hundreds of thousands of new tokens monthly, [millions in revenue](https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/address/CebN5WGQ4jvEPvsVU4EoHEpgzq1VV7AbicfhtW4xC9iM), and a trail of human wreckage.

  

**Child exploitation content slipped through. Violence proliferated. Animal abuse streams ran until completion.**

  

_Even with livestreams disabled, has pump.fun already crossed the line from degeneracy to criminality, and how long before authorities declare it pump.done?_

_The platform that gave birth to countless meme tokens has spawned something far more sinister - an online arena where human suffering is monetized and trauma becomes entertainment._

  

**When the hammer falls, it might not be crypto regulators leading the charge - federal agencies that prosecute broadcasted criminal acts carry far heavier consequences.**

  

With no basic safeguards or even terms of service, pump.fun operates like an unregulated Fight Club where the first rule is "anything goes."

  

In pursuit of the next viral moment, pump.fun has become a breeding ground for society's darkest impulses - a digital colosseum where attention-seeking meets self-destruction.

  

This was not Santoshi's vision for the blockchain.  
  
We have become the meme.

  
**Maybe the madness has come to an end, for now…**

  

_How much darkness did pump.fun broadcast before finally killing the lights?_
