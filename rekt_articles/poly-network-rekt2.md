_Poly Network is back._

**Almost two years after topping the [leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) with a [complex hack](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) of over $600M, this time the losses totalled just $4.4M.**

_And the attack was a simple case of a compromised 3-of-4 multisig._

When [Lazarus](https://rekt.news/big-phish/) knocked Poly off the top spot with the [Ronin bridge](https://rekt.news/ronin-rekt/) exploit, 5 of 9 validator keys were compromised. Apparently, Poly still thought that an even lower bar was acceptable.

The team eventually [acknowledged](https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675384703149568001) the attack, informing users that bridging services had been paused and making a call for help to the security community. In a follow-up, Poly [clarified](https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675592129727418370) that “_57 assets have been affected on 10 blockchains_”

**Prompting flashbacks of the first hack, which at the time totalled more than the entire rest of the leaderboard combined, initial reports [used](https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1675544670263209984) a notional value of $42B of minted assets.**

_But [low liquidity](https://twitter.com/MetisDAO/status/1675347320588718080) on destination chains meant the attacker was only able to cash out a few million._

**It seems we only ever hear of Poly Network when they’re hacked…**

_…who knew they were even still around?_

**In contrast to Poly’s last incident, this time appears to be a far simpler case of compromised keys; three of four multisig signers validated deposit proofs, granting the attacker access to funds.**

The attack process involved locking a small amount of tokens on one chain, then withdrawing a larger amount on a different chain via forged proofs, repeated for various assets and chains.

Although the notional value of assets minted reached into the tens of billions, the attacker could only access [around $4.4M](https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1675436475595526144) of Poly’s liquidity, with further assets remaining in the attacker’s address.

**Blockchain bridges create bottlenecks where funds accumulate on either side, often secured by a flimsy threshold of just a few EOAs.**

_[Time](https://rekt.news/ronin-rekt/) and [again](https://rekt.news/harmony-rekt/) we have seen hundreds of millions lost to just a few signatures._

Last time Poly was rekt, [on-chain negotiations](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b6009ea08c868d7c5c336bf1bc30c33b87a0eedd59dac8c26e6a8551b20b68a) resulted in a happy ending, as funds were returned and the whitehat [offered](https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1427574236483231749#) a Chief Security Advisor role on top of a $500k bounty.

**Luckily, far less was lost in this time.**

_Will Poly learn their lesson?_

_Or will they go for the hat trick?_
